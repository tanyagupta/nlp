Governor Bush,

            I am sponsoring a fellow US Navy Chief Petty Officer's retirement from active duty, and he has expressed his desire to have a flag flown over the capital building for his shadow box, as well as a Certificate of Appreciation from you for his faithful service of over 20 years.  I am requesting guidance on obtaining these items.  Corry Station, located in Pensacola, is the beginning for nearly all of Cryptologic Technicians in the US Navy, and as it was where he began his naval career, he would like to be able to reflect that in his retirement.  Please direct me on how to obtain the Certificate of Appreciation, as well as the procedures in how to acquire a flag that has been flown over the capitol of your great state.

 

Thank you for your support of our military services.

 

Very respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush:

 

My dear friend Guenter Braun has worked for the US Army in Baumholder, Germany since the 1970’s.  He has always been a true friend to the American people and sincerely loves us.  I worked with him personally in waterworks and emergency electrical generators at Landstuhl hospital in 1977 – 1979.  And he has been a true pal to me ever since.

 

Is there any honorary thing we can offer this friend of mine and the people of this nation?  Guenter is the kind of person that we should encourage to visit this state.  And, maybe someday settle here with his family as one of us.

Subject:	Recognition of Service to the USA.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

My dear friend Guenter Braun has worked for the US Army in Baumholder, Germany since the 1970’s.  He has always been a true friend to the American people and sincerely loves us.  I worked with him personally in waterworks and emergency electrical generators at Landstuhl hospital in 1977 – 1979.  And he has been a true pal to me ever since.

 

Is there any honorary thing we can offer this friend of mine and the people of this nation?  Guenter is the kind of person that we should encourage to visit this state.  And, maybe someday settle here with his family as one of us.

 

In advance, thank you for your time.

 

Sincerely,

 

Jim Brunson

Dear Mr. Bart,
Governor Bush received your request for a letter and asked me to respond.  The Governor is happy to accommodate your request, but needs to know your grandfather's name and the address where you would like the letter sent.  We can either mail it directly to your grandfather, or we can mail it to you, so that you can present it to him.  Please send this information to my attention.
Sincerely,

Is there a protocol for recognizing 100 year old citizens who reside in the state of Florida? My grandfather will be turning 100 in May 2007, lives in Hollywood Beach.  I wanted to line up some appropriate acknowledgements for his party being planned for that date.  Your response is appreciated.

Dear Lieutenant Smith,
Governor Bush received your request for a letter and asked me to respond. The Governor is happy to accommodate your request, but needs the request to be on official letterhead, signed by a commanding officer or career counselor. There is also a form that needs to be filled out, which I have attached to this email in a Word document. After you have completed the form, the best way to return it to me is via fax, 850-487-0801. 
Also, Governor Bush's term ends January 1, 2007. If the retirement date is after January 1, 2007, we will hold your request until after Governor-elect Crist is inaugurated, unless you specifically requests Governor Bush's signature. If that is the case, please let us know what date you would like us to use on the letter, provided it is on or before January 1, 2007. 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

I am writing to you today to gather some information on the possibility of a letter of appreciation from the governor to a USAF Pilot who will soon be retiring.  The retiree is a resident of FL and has expressed interest in receiving a letter of thanks, that will ultimately be presented at the ceremony.  I am just doing preliminary research at the moment, but am also working on a tight time line.  Any information you could provide on the process or if this is even possible would be great.
