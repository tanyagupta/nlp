Subject: sorry sent too soon


My previous message was sent too soon due to technical difficulties. As I was
saying, the Writing Enhancement Program was instituted under the state law
called The GORDON BILL sponsored by Sen Jack Gordon and it called for class
size caps in high school English classes.  Teachers were not allowed to have
more than four classes of NO MORE than 25 students each!

Teachers were required to teach serious writing skills and there was a major
piece of written material required of students every week. Teachers got an
additional plan period to grade essays. Score went up dramatically in such a
short period that state universities stopped complaining about the need for
remedial classes for incoming freshmen.  This was, if you'll recall, a
complaint made by state universities recently and was one justification for
the creation of the FCAT.

The folks in the seminar were just full of chargrin and irony when they
remarked that as soon as it started to work......THE STATE KILLED IT.  WELL
SIR...BRING IT BACK!!!
