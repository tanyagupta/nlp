Seals are wonderful divers. Some seals can
dive several hundred feet below the surface.
On deep dives, they can stay underwater up to
40 minutes without surfacing to breathe. They
have special features to help save oxygen on
such dives. When seals dive, they stop
breathing. For very deep dives, their blood
flow to everything except critical organs stops
or slows. Seals can also slow their heart rates,
sometimes to one-tenth the rates at the
surface.
You may wonder how seals avoid the bends
on deep dives. The bends are a painful
condition. They are caused when nitrogen
dissolves inâ€¦
