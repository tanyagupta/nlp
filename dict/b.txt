Bunny,

Attached please find three letters.  One responding to those asking "What has Florida done to help?" another responding to those asking "What can I do to help?" and a third responding to those asking "How can I get help?"  I also included an attachment page with contact information and suggestions from a variety of charitable organization involved in the recovery effort. I found this information on the Volunteer Florida web page and thought it might be useful so, I turned it into a Fact Sheet of sorts.

I hope this will help you with the all of the letters and emails you have received!

Sorry for the delay, Let me know if this works.
 
Thank you for writing to Governor Jeb Bush regarding Florida's Fiscal Year 2005-06 budget.  The Governor appreciates receiving your comments and asked that I respond on his behalf.

Funding for the Pork Producers Transition Grant was not included in the final state budget for 2005-06.  The Governor seeks to provide good stewardship of taxpayer dollars and therefore provides the Legislature with the criteria he uses to evaluate individual member projects.  For a list of these criteria, visit <http://www.myflorida.com/myflorida/government/laws/2005legislation/2005action.html>. 

The 2005-06 state budget focuses on high performing, high priority programs, including educating our children, helping needy families, ensuring public safety and building infrastructure.  Programs vetoed by the Governor return money to the General Revenue fund to support these priorities.

Again, thank you for taking the time to share your comments with the Governor.  Please be assured Governor Bush carefully considered the thoughts and concerns of citizens like you as he made his decisions regarding the 2005-06 budget.

Dear:

Thank you for expressing your support for an increase in funding for the Centers for Autism and Related Disabilities.  During the preparation of the Governor's Recommended 2005-06 Budget, which began last fall, the Education Unit within the Executive Office of the Governor had not received any requests for increased funding for the CARD.   Accordingly, in the Governor's Recommended Budget, the seven Centers for Autism and Related Disabilities were level funded at $4,975,000 for Fiscal Year 2005-06.

The Department of Education provides us with their recommended budget.  There was no increase recommended for the CARD.  This is the result of numerous factors.  As does the Executive Office of the Governor, the department reviews and considers requests and documented expressions of need.  

As you know, both the House of Representatives and Senate develop their own bugets.  Likewise the House of Representatives and Senate, when developing their budgets, respond to documented and expressed needs.  Professional lobbyists; representatives of affected associations and other entities, both private and public; university representatives; as well as individuals, can and do provide input, early on, regarding programmatic fiscal needs.  They contact their Senators and Representatives as well as members of both the House and Senate Appropriation Committees.   

The House and Senate of course take into consideration the Governor's Recommended Budget and the Department's  Recommended Budget when drafting their own budgets, but clearly neither the House nor the Senate are in any way bound by the Govenor's budget.  The Education Unit is not a part of the House or Senate budget negotiation process and cannot change their decisions.  Ultimately the House and Senate compromise, and together create the final budget. Once the budget is passed, the Governor does have the authority to veto line items.

The House and Senate level funded the Centers for Autism and Related Disabilities at $4,975,000 and added $243,000 in their final budget for autism and related services specifically at Florida Atlantic University, which was a decision negotiated by members of the House and Senate.   The 2005-06 budget has been finalized.  

We can, however, look prospectively.  As a result of the numerous e-mails the Governor received regarding this program, our staff have contacted the Autisim Society of Florida and others, and discussed the concerns expressed in the many emails received by the Governor.   This fall, we will be developing the Governor's Recommended Budget for the 2006-07 Fiscal Year and will consider future CARD needs.  You may also wish to contact university staff and Legislators.  You can locate your Legislator's contact information at the following web page:  www.leg.state.fl.us.  In addition, you may wish to correspond with the department regarding your concerns:  Department of Education, Bureau of Exceptional Education & Student Services, 614 Turlington Building, 325 West Gaines Street, Tallahassee, Florida  32399-0400.

Again, the Governor appreciates your input and will consider your needs in preparation of his next Recommended Budget.




Sincerely,
