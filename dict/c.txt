Dear Governor,
 
I know these days are very difficult for you and the President. I want you to know, BOTH of you have my support now and in the past.  It kills me to see how the media "reports" the news about the two of you.  I will never understand how the President can tolerate all the untruths being said about him.  But thank you for doing a fine job for Florida.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am an admirer of the entire Bush family..having cast my first (and second) presidential votes for your father, then you twice, and our President two times.
 
I just wanted you to know how proud I am of all the work you've done as governor of this state.  I especially was thrilled about the signing of the tort reform and hope that it helps stem the flood of frivilous lawsuits.  And thanks for keeping Florida a low tax state.  You've been an able, capable, and forward thinking chief executive of this state and I hope to be able to cast more votes for you and members of your family in the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Millie Watson Oberheu

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

 

I have to admit that when you were first voted into office, I was not too happy about it.  Now that I see what you have done for the state of Florida, I am impressed and glad to call you my governor!  You have done a tremendous job on the disaster plans and I appreciate your insight and perseverance concerning legal reform.  I thank you for all your hard work and sleepless nights.

Regarding: 17-2S-25-0000-0002-0310; Allowing the FLUM map to be used to violate comprehensive plan policy and code and pave over wetlands to expand a Red Light District
 
Dear Secretary Cohen and Mr. Gauthier,
 

1.	On 20 June 2006, I received an email from the Governor’s office stating he has forwarded my concerns on this matter to you and asked you to contact me.


2.	In July of 2001, Okaloosa County justified an amendment to the Florida Future Land Use Map (FLUM) to convert the subject property from Residential to Urban Mixed Use (UMU) based upon statements from the Chair of Okaloosa Department of Growth that the narrow area between the wetlands and the existing single-family homes could not be developed and would remain a natural buffer. This was supported by the data in documented the 2 July 2001 Planning Report Data & Analysis for the Small Scale Amendment and documented in the 12 July 2001 Minutes of the Okaloosa County Planning Commission. 


3.	Now not only is Okaloosa County ignoring the conditions in which they authorized the amendment to the FLUM map, thus invalidating the justification for the change, they also intend to waive code and violate the required polices documented in the Okaloosa Comprehensive Plan signed into effect by your office.  They claim the reason for this would be an inability for the developer to care for the required planting, which is a 100% falsehood.  


4.	Okaloosa County officials appear to have manipulated a change to the FLUM based on false promises and false justification and now are providing false justification in order waive Code and Comprehensive Plan polices, so a developer can connect the red light district to our homes, by serving alcohol on the manipulated land, which was shown as residential on the FLUM, and creating parking and a throughway over protected wetlands, thus providing easy access for the strip club patrons to come within just a couple feet from backyards and bedroom windows of the homes in my neighborhood.  


5.	You can not sit back while your approved maps plans are manipulated into vehicles to allow the very things they were designed to prevent.  


6.	Please, you must take immediate action to cease all development until a full investigation and inspection can be conducted at the state level to prevent this manipulation of the state FLUM and state approved comprehensive plan.

Regarding: Technical Review Committee (TRC), June 15, 2006 279733-CPS-2005 “Merrick’s (a.k.a. A.J.’s Fish Camp)” and Request for a Vote at a Public Hearing regarding the proper enforcement of Code
 
Dear Commissioners & Department of Growth Management of Okaloosa County, Please help us;
 
1.       At the TRC you received comments from Mr. Barbee and Mr. Calobrisi on the plans for the A.J.’s Fish Camp that is proposed next to my neighborhood. With the exception of the one retracted comment, I support these comments.  


2.       Specifically, my greatest concerns include the following:
a.       In recent years you have allowed more sales of alcohol close to my home. An establishment within 1500 feet of my home has gone from serving alcohol with food to serving alcohol with adult entertainment. Since then alcohol related crime has increased and people in my neighborhood have dealt with unwelcome intoxicated strangers, who awaken us and trespass our properties late at night. There are already too many alcohol related disturbances in our area, too many alcohol related accidents on our adjacent roadways, and the owner of this new development has stated publicly that he plans to serve alcohol. 
b.       Please do not waive the Okaloosa Land Development (LDC) Code 6.05.073, Location of Screening. 6.05.073 requires that: “No off-street parking may be permitted within any required screen area. Where plant materials are required the required amount shall be installed on the side of any wall or fence opposite the new development”. It is essential to our safety and the value of our property that 6.05.073 not be waived. 
                        i.      If 6.05.073 is waived, there will be nothing to stop the possibly highly intoxicated patrons of this new development from trespassing into the buffer zone, placing those trespassers very close the back yards of some of our homes. The buffer needs to keep such traffic at least away from all of our properties. 
                      ii.      If 6.05.073 is waived, there will be little that could stop the patrons from driving over or parking in the buffer. A curb and a few plantings that degrade with time will not be sufficient. If the plantings are outside the fence, we can provide witness to help the County ensure they are properly maintained and the integrity of the buffer is maintained. 
                     iii.      If you waive 6.05.073, you will block the water view from some of the properties in our neighborhood and lower the overall value of all the properties in our neighborhood. 
                    iv.      It is clear that the intent of 6.05.073 is to provide a compatibility and intensity buffer to protect the homes, and not a garden or parking area for the new development. If 6.05.073 is waived, the County will fail to support Okaloosa Comprehensive Plan Policies, including those in Chapter 2.1 Policy 4.1.     
                      v.      Proper enforcement of 6.05.073 would reduce crime and the cost to the county from future disturbances. Our single-family homes were very nice and safe when they were built; please help us fight to keep them that way.
                    vi.      There is no justifiable reason to waive 6.05.073. Even if the plantings are placed outside the fence as required, the business can still have easy access to care for and water the planted area.
c.       Please strictly enforce the Okaloosa County LDC Code 6.05.071. Code 6.05.071 requires that: “Where a single-family residential zone abuts a residential local or residential collector street and a non-residential use is adjacent to the right-of-way, screening shall be located on the property developed for non-residential purpose, to the extent that the non-residential use is generally screened from residential view.”
                        i.      It appears that the county is considering approval of a plan which will not generally screen the proposed development from our single-family homes. 
                      ii.      At the TRC, the County planner Marissa Martinez indicated an 8 foot fence could be used. Please ensure an 8 foot fence is used to enclose the entire development and 12 feet of plantings on the non-residential land are between us and the fence.  For compatibility, we require more than just the outside of a fence, less than a yard from some of the property in our neighborhood.   
                     iii.      Please do not allow any elevated signs that are not generally screened from the view of our properties, especially the proposed billboard!   
                    iv.      Please ensure the existing trees of large bulk, like the large Magnolia, are maintained on the property. Even an 8 foot fence with a 12 foot exterior buffer will not generally screen all areas of our properties. These majestic large trees are in harmony with the existing wetland area and required to ensure the non-residential use is generally screened from view. 


3.       On December 3, 2002; Charles Gauthier, Chief Burro of Local Planning, of the Florida Department of Community Affairs signed the Okaloosa Comprehensive Plan into compliance. If these codes established to enforce this Comprehensive Plan are waived, then the Plan has failed us, our County officials will have failed us, and our State leaders will have failed us, and we will become the victims of poorly managed growth and alcohol related disturbances.  If you are unable to enforce the Comprehensive Plan yourselves, please seek the aid of the Florida Department of Community Affairs and our Governor’s Office. Please identify who in the County and State are willing to help us, so that we may help ensure those officials are given the opportunity to continue to serve us.      


4.       In July of 2001, Okaloosa County justified an amendment to the Florida Future Land Use Map (FLUM) to convert the subject property from Residential to Urban Mixed Use (UMU) based upon statements from the Chair of Okaloosa Department of Growth that the narrow area between the wetlands and the existing single-family homes could not be developed and would remain a natural buffer. This was supported by the data in documented the 2 July 2001 Planning Report Data & Analysis for the Small Scale Amendment and documented in the 12 July 2001 Minutes of the Okaloosa County Planning Commission. 


5.       Please do not waive the legally enforceable Land Development Codes and Policies in the Comprehensive Plan as they are our only means of adequate protection. It is our legally entitled protection, and it should not be waived.  Please use every legal means at your disposal to provide as much of the buffer promised in 2001 as possible. Codes 6.05.073 and 6.05.071 enable you to protect us and help keep the promises made to our neighborhood in 2001. If you waive policy and code now, the amendment to the FLUM would appear to be based on falsehoods and you will to allow the FLUM amendment cheat the rights of the adjacent single-family home owners. These codes and policies are our best and only means of protection. Please do not waive them. Please spare us and the children of our neighborhood this progressively worsening situation. 


6.       Please reply to me in writing and address each concern listed above. If there is any possibility of a waiver to these much needed ordinances to ensure the safety and value of my neighborhood, then I formally request all development approval activities are halted until this matter can be voted on by the Okaloosa County Commission at a public hearing. Please ensure the hearing is in the southern seat of the County and during the evening hours so that the hardworking citizens in our local area can attend and voice our concerns. Please include in the letter the time, date, and location of this public hearing and the next TRC review for this new development. 
 
Sincerely,

Rex
 
We have a state issue you can help with.  In 2001, the county amended the state future land use map (FLUM) of the lot between what turned into a strip club club and my home.
 
This lot contains a stream and wetlands.
 
In amending the FLUM the county documented that the part of lot between the stream and our homes was to be left undeveloped and a natural buffer.
 
Now new county officials are about to allow parking for another business that serves alcohol to be put on the the part of the land that was not to be developed and left as a buffer.  
 
Minutes document the buffer.
 
The buffer was the justification to allow the change to the state map.
 
Please you have to help us.  Do not them them pave over the wetlands and expand the Red Light District into our homes.
 
It was previosly ruled that this FLUM matter was a state matter and you should help our county do the right thing.  
 
Please respond.

The Capitol; 400 South Monroe Street; 
Tallahassee, FL 32399
 
Dear Governor and Lady Bush,
 
Regarding: Okaloosa County Red Light District 51, next to a small single-family home neighborhood which is struggling to survive.  
 
Can you please help us?  We desperately need to close down the growing Red Light District 51 that recently formed and is threatening expansion.  
 
We need a strong state law that will permanently close down all bars and adult entertainment clubs within 1000 feet of single-family home neighborhoods.  
 
Our local Mother's Against Drunk Driving Chapter has proposed a very reasonable ordinance to keep bars 1000 feet from homes, and propose earlier closing times, but our local commissioners have indicated they would not support such an ordinance.  No one seems to know how to close down the strip clubs or at least get them away from our homes.  
 
After we all bought our homes, they turned the Italian restaurant next door into a strip club.  Our research shows this strip club is on residentially zoned land.  They are open late (until 4:00 am), are very noisy, and people in the parking lot sometimes scream and peal out in their cars.  
 
Now a new developer is trying to put up another establishment, which he has indicated will serve alcohol.  He shows no barrier between his new proposed business and the strip club and will effectively bring the red light district right up to our back yards and within 25 feet of our bedroom windows.
 
I have seen State Ordinances that keep bars and adult entertainment away from schools, but children spend more time in their homes than at school and we all need protection of our homes from such places.  
 
Please help us.
 
Please contact the Okaloosa County Commissioners and ask them to stop the expansion of Red Light District 51.  
 
Please develop strict state laws that keep all bars and adult entertainment clubs at least 1000 to 2500 feet from all single-family homes.  
 
Sincerely,

 Regarding: Adult Entertainment Ordinances in Okaloosa County and Red Light District 51 
 Dear Honorable Commissioners of Okaloosa County, 

1.       Please provide me a written reference to the County Ordinances regarding Adult Entertainment.  


2.       Please provide me a written explanation of why Club 51 is allowed on the residentially zoned portion of parcel 17-2S-25-0000-0002-0280, which lies just a few feet from single-family homes and a neighborhood with small children and working adults who need to be asleep early so they can be productive members of the community the next day.   Since Club 51 went into business, loud booming tones from inside the club and car noises and screaming voices from patrons in the club parking lot can be heard from within the sealed bedrooms of the neighboring single-family homes.  When I bought my home, it was a nice quire neighborhood.  Surely the rights of the long standing residents of single-family homes out weigh the rights of an owner of residentially zoned land to create a red light district on residential property.

Regarding: 17-2S-25-0000-0002-0310; Allowing the FLUM map to be used to violate comprehensive plan policy and code and pave over wetlands to expand a Red Light District
 
Dear Secretary Cohen and Mr. Gauthier,
 

1.	On 20 June 2006, I received an email from the Governor’s office stating he has forwarded my concerns on this matter to you and asked you to contact me.


2.	In July of 2001, Okaloosa County justified an amendment to the Florida Future Land Use Map (FLUM) to convert the subject property from Residential to Urban Mixed Use (UMU) based upon statements from the Chair of Okaloosa Department of Growth that the narrow area between the wetlands and the existing single-family homes could not be developed and would remain a natural buffer. This was supported by the data in documented the 2 July 2001 Planning Report Data & Analysis for the Small Scale Amendment and documented in the 12 July 2001 Minutes of the Okaloosa County Planning Commission. 


3.	Now not only is Okaloosa County ignoring the conditions in which they authorized the amendment to the FLUM map, thus invalidating the justification for the change, they also intend to waive code and violate the required polices documented in the Okaloosa Comprehensive Plan signed into effect by your office.  They claim the reason for this would be an inability for the developer to care for the required planting, which is a 100% falsehood.  


4.	Okaloosa County officials appear to have manipulated a change to the FLUM based on false promises and false justification and now are providing false justification in order waive Code and Comprehensive Plan polices, so a developer can connect the red light district to our homes, by serving alcohol on the manipulated land, which was shown as residential on the FLUM, and creating parking and a throughway over protected wetlands, thus providing easy access for the strip club patrons to come within just a couple feet from backyards and bedroom windows of the homes in my neighborhood.  


5.	You can not sit back while your approved maps plans are manipulated into vehicles to allow the very things they were designed to prevent.  


6.	Please, you must take immediate action to cease all development until a full investigation and inspection can be conducted at the state level to prevent this manipulation of the state FLUM and state approved comprehensive plan.

Regarding: Technical Review Committee (TRC), June 15, 2006 279733-CPS-2005 “Merrick’s (a.k.a. A.J.’s Fish Camp)” and Request for a Vote at a Public Hearing regarding the proper enforcement of Code
 
Dear Commissioners & Department of Growth Management of Okaloosa County, Please help us;
 
1.       At the TRC you received comments from Mr. Barbee and Mr. Calobrisi on the plans for the A.J.’s Fish Camp that is proposed next to my neighborhood. With the exception of the one retracted comment, I support these comments.  


2.       Specifically, my greatest concerns include the following:
a.       In recent years you have allowed more sales of alcohol close to my home. An establishment within 1500 feet of my home has gone from serving alcohol with food to serving alcohol with adult entertainment. Since then alcohol related crime has increased and people in my neighborhood have dealt with unwelcome intoxicated strangers, who awaken us and trespass our properties late at night. There are already too many alcohol related disturbances in our area, too many alcohol related accidents on our adjacent roadways, and the owner of this new development has stated publicly that he plans to serve alcohol. 
b.       Please do not waive the Okaloosa Land Development (LDC) Code 6.05.073, Location of Screening. 6.05.073 requires that: “No off-street parking may be permitted within any required screen area. Where plant materials are required the required amount shall be installed on the side of any wall or fence opposite the new development”. It is essential to our safety and the value of our property that 6.05.073 not be waived. 
                        i.      If 6.05.073 is waived, there will be nothing to stop the possibly highly intoxicated patrons of this new development from trespassing into the buffer zone, placing those trespassers very close the back yards of some of our homes. The buffer needs to keep such traffic at least away from all of our properties. 
                      ii.      If 6.05.073 is waived, there will be little that could stop the patrons from driving over or parking in the buffer. A curb and a few plantings that degrade with time will not be sufficient. If the plantings are outside the fence, we can provide witness to help the County ensure they are properly maintained and the integrity of the buffer is maintained. 
                     iii.      If you waive 6.05.073, you will block the water view from some of the properties in our neighborhood and lower the overall value of all the properties in our neighborhood. 
                    iv.      It is clear that the intent of 6.05.073 is to provide a compatibility and intensity buffer to protect the homes, and not a garden or parking area for the new development. If 6.05.073 is waived, the County will fail to support Okaloosa Comprehensive Plan Policies, including those in Chapter 2.1 Policy 4.1.     
                      v.      Proper enforcement of 6.05.073 would reduce crime and the cost to the county from future disturbances. Our single-family homes were very nice and safe when they were built; please help us fight to keep them that way.
                    vi.      There is no justifiable reason to waive 6.05.073. Even if the plantings are placed outside the fence as required, the business can still have easy access to care for and water the planted area.
c.       Please strictly enforce the Okaloosa County LDC Code 6.05.071. Code 6.05.071 requires that: “Where a single-family residential zone abuts a residential local or residential collector street and a non-residential use is adjacent to the right-of-way, screening shall be located on the property developed for non-residential purpose, to the extent that the non-residential use is generally screened from residential view.”
                        i.      It appears that the county is considering approval of a plan which will not generally screen the proposed development from our single-family homes. 
                      ii.      At the TRC, the County planner Marissa Martinez indicated an 8 foot fence could be used. Please ensure an 8 foot fence is used to enclose the entire development and 12 feet of plantings on the non-residential land are between us and the fence.  For compatibility, we require more than just the outside of a fence, less than a yard from some of the property in our neighborhood.   
                     iii.      Please do not allow any elevated signs that are not generally screened from the view of our properties, especially the proposed billboard!   
                    iv.      Please ensure the existing trees of large bulk, like the large Magnolia, are maintained on the property. Even an 8 foot fence with a 12 foot exterior buffer will not generally screen all areas of our properties. These majestic large trees are in harmony with the existing wetland area and required to ensure the non-residential use is generally screened from view. 


3.       On December 3, 2002; Charles Gauthier, Chief Burro of Local Planning, of the Florida Department of Community Affairs signed the Okaloosa Comprehensive Plan into compliance. If these codes established to enforce this Comprehensive Plan are waived, then the Plan has failed us, our County officials will have failed us, and our State leaders will have failed us, and we will become the victims of poorly managed growth and alcohol related disturbances.  If you are unable to enforce the Comprehensive Plan yourselves, please seek the aid of the Florida Department of Community Affairs and our Governor’s Office. Please identify who in the County and State are willing to help us, so that we may help ensure those officials are given the opportunity to continue to serve us.      


4.       In July of 2001, Okaloosa County justified an amendment to the Florida Future Land Use Map (FLUM) to convert the subject property from Residential to Urban Mixed Use (UMU) based upon statements from the Chair of Okaloosa Department of Growth that the narrow area between the wetlands and the existing single-family homes could not be developed and would remain a natural buffer. This was supported by the data in documented the 2 July 2001 Planning Report Data & Analysis for the Small Scale Amendment and documented in the 12 July 2001 Minutes of the Okaloosa County Planning Commission. 


5.       Please do not waive the legally enforceable Land Development Codes and Policies in the Comprehensive Plan as they are our only means of adequate protection. It is our legally entitled protection, and it should not be waived.  Please use every legal means at your disposal to provide as much of the buffer promised in 2001 as possible. Codes 6.05.073 and 6.05.071 enable you to protect us and help keep the promises made to our neighborhood in 2001. If you waive policy and code now, the amendment to the FLUM would appear to be based on falsehoods and you will to allow the FLUM amendment cheat the rights of the adjacent single-family home owners. These codes and policies are our best and only means of protection. Please do not waive them. Please spare us and the children of our neighborhood this progressively worsening situation. 


6.       Please reply to me in writing and address each concern listed above. If there is any possibility of a waiver to these much needed ordinances to ensure the safety and value of my neighborhood, then I formally request all development approval activities are halted until this matter can be voted on by the Okaloosa County Commission at a public hearing. Please ensure the hearing is in the southern seat of the County and during the evening hours so that the hardworking citizens in our local area can attend and voice our concerns. Please include in the letter the time, date, and location of this public hearing and the next TRC review for this new development.

Subject: [*] RE: Okaloosa County Red Light District 51 on Residential Land


Rex
 
We have a state issue you can help with.  In 2001, the county amended the state future land use map (FLUM) of the lot between what turned into a strip club club and my home.
 
This lot contains a stream and wetlands.
 
In amending the FLUM the county documented that the part of lot between the stream and our homes was to be left undeveloped and a natural buffer.
 
Now new county officials are about to allow parking for another business that serves alcohol to be put on the the part of the land that was not to be developed and left as a buffer.  
 
Minutes document the buffer.
 
The buffer was the justification to allow the change to the state map.
 
Please you have to help us.  Do not them them pave over the wetlands and expand the Red Light District into our homes.
 
It was previosly ruled that this FLUM matter was a state matter and you should help our county do the right thing.  
 
Please respond.

Governor and First Lady Bush
The Capitol; 400 South Monroe Street; 
Tallahassee, FL 32399
 
Dear Governor and Lady Bush,
 
Regarding: Okaloosa County Red Light District 51, next to a small single-family home neighborhood which is struggling to survive.  
 
Can you please help us?  We desperately need to close down the growing Red Light District 51 that recently formed and is threatening expansion.  
 
We need a strong state law that will permanently close down all bars and adult entertainment clubs within 1000 feet of single-family home neighborhoods.  
 
Our local Mother's Against Drunk Driving Chapter has proposed a very reasonable ordinance to keep bars 1000 feet from homes, and propose earlier closing times, but our local commissioners have indicated they would not support such an ordinance.  No one seems to know how to close down the strip clubs or at least get them away from our homes.  
 
After we all bought our homes, they turned the Italian restaurant next door into a strip club.  Our research shows this strip club is on residentially zoned land.  They are open late (until 4:00 am), are very noisy, and people in the parking lot sometimes scream and peal out in their cars.  
 
Now a new developer is trying to put up another establishment, which he has indicated will serve alcohol.  He shows no barrier between his new proposed business and the strip club and will effectively bring the red light district right up to our back yards and within 25 feet of our bedroom windows.
 
I have seen State Ordinances that keep bars and adult entertainment away from schools, but children spend more time in their homes than at school and we all need protection of our homes from such places.  
 
Please help us.
 
Please contact the Okaloosa County Commissioners and ask them to stop the expansion of Red Light District 51.  
 
Please develop strict state laws that keep all bars and adult entertainment clubs at least 1000 to 2500 feet from all single-family homes.  
 
Sincerely,

Since Club 51 went into business, loud booming tones from inside the club and car noises and screaming voices from patrons in the club parking lot can be heard from within the sealed bedrooms of the neighboring single-family homes.  When I bought my home, it was a nice quire neighborhood.  Surely the rights of the long standing residents of single-family homes out weigh the rights of an owner of residentially zoned land to create a red light district on residential property.

Govenor Bush, 

Thanks for being a governor of the people and for the people. You have 
been a govenor we can be proud of.

Praying God will bless you with good health and a desire to continue 
in politics, we need honest people like you and President Bush and 
Barbara.

I am sad at the voting record of Martinez, he certainly isn't really 
listening to what the voters want! Breaking the law is still a crime. 
I was raised to obey the law and I raised my children the same as did 
most of the good Americans in our country.

Have a blessed day

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for the great job you are doing for our beautiful State of
Florida.  I wish it
were possible for you to run for another term as Governor but since that
is not possible
maybe another public office.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Also, I
wanted you to know
how proud I am of  Florida's Disaster Plan.  It makes a Floridian feel
great to know that
we have the best Plan in the nation and that we will not be alone
before, during or after
a disaster.  I do believe in personal responsibility, though.  An
individual must take it upon
themselves to be prepared and not totally depend on the government for
every need.

Also, I am a strong supporter of  President Bush.  I campaigned for the
President in 2004.
It was my first time to campaign for the President.  It was a very
rewarding experience.  It
was also my first time to vote in a Presidential election.  I had never
thought that my vote would
really matter but I felt so strongly for President Bush to be reelected
that I knew I had to vote.
I stayed up all night to watch the results and when he won Florida and
then won the election I was
so proud that I had participated.  I wish President Bush could run for
another term.  We need to change the term limits but just for
Republicans.  I voted for the very first time for you in the last
election.  I met you in West Palm Beach at the corner of Palm Beach
Lakes Blvd. and Okeechobee Blvd. during your last campaign.  It was the
night before the election.

Thank you to you and President Bush for doing such a great job for
Florida and the United
States of America.

Sincerely,

Donna S. Johnson

Jupiter, FL   33478

P.S.  I was wondering if it would be possible to get a personally
autographed picture of you.
I have some very nice photographs of President Bush but none of you.  If
it would be possible
it would be greatly appreciated..

Dear Ms. Jennings,

 

I wanted to forward you an email that I sent to Governor Bush. Given your role in economic development for the state of Florida, I wanted to make sure you were copied on my correspondence to Mr. Bush.

 

As Florida grows in the biotech industry, one of its biggest competitive challenges is recruiting top professionals to the state. Because concentrations of Bioscience companies are in other areas of the country, it is organizations like ABFO that will bring more professional weight and competitive networking opportunity to our state. I have never done anything like this, but I am determined to make it happen… and I will contact every resource available to me.

 

Any assistance the state can give me in introductions to professionals that might have interest in this new association would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for all your administration does to encourage economic development and the Florida biotech community.

Governor Bush,

 

I know you probably receive many messages and I will keep mine short in light of your schedule.

 

I am a Controller for a biotech company near Gainesville, FL and I am working very hard to bring a support organization to our state. Several weeks ago, I had a wonderful opportunity to attend an ABFO (http://www.abfointernational.org/membership/) conference in San Francisco, CA. ABFO, which is the Association for Bioscience Financial Officers, is an organization dedicated to the financial community within the biotech industry. While I can continue to gain support at annual conferences generated by the national organization, there are more active local chapters throughout the U.S. The closest regional chapter to our state is in North Carolina and after attending a regional coordinators meeting at the national conference, I expressed interest and determination to start our own chapter. Local chapters offer breakfast meetings and quarterly dinners, offering special topics and speakers of interest in the financial area of our industry. I believe this organization can help our growth in Florida.

 

I have been working with Pete Roddy, who is the national chairman of ABFO and Richard Ramko of Ernst & Young, who is a sponsor of the organization. I would like to and am willing to meet with Controllers and CFO's throughout the state to bring this organization to Florida in 2006. Thanks to your office and the efforts of many others, Florida is gaining in the biotech industry and I have no doubt this organization will add to that line of support. ABFO offers support to biotech and pharma companies of all sizes. It was a great experience to be mentored by others in our industry and learn how others apply laws and regulations to our profession. I found this conference to be hands on and quite informative for our industry and I am determined to start a Florida chapter this year.

 

Just so you know, my boss, Sue Washer (you have met her), is in full support of my efforts. Is there anything you can do to help me; perhaps with introductions?

 

We appreciate your work in our state and for the growth of our industry. I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Respectfully,

Subject: [*] Patient Assistance Programs
 
Governor Bush-
 
To make a long story short, almost 2 years ago I had been unemployed due to a worker's comp injury and loss of my job, and I was without insurance.  I had a heart attack in 2001 and take 6-8 prescription meds for my heart condition.  I accidently stumbled onto a web site that gave me information on Patient Assistance Programs that would help pay for my meds. I was able, through application to the drug manufacturers, to get all of my prescriptions, free of cost.  It was a Godsend and I probably would not be alive today if I hadn't pursued the option.
 
The reason that I am writing to you is because Florida has no programs to help people like me.  I feel now that I am compelled to become an advocate of these Patient Assistance Programs.  I want to help other people who can not afford to get their prescription meds because of financial hardship, or even hurricane or tornado losses.  I have done some research and I can do this but the number of people that I can help depends largely on financial support as well as legal advice.  I am wondering if there are any agencies that you could lead me to for more information.  Also, is it possible to apply for funding through the state and how would I do that?  
 
I would love to sit and talk to you about this because I feel from the bottom of my heart that this is a very necessary opportunity for residents of this state. I live in Venice, work in Sarasota (Sarasota County) and would have to restrict my assistance to the time that I can put into this as I have a full time job.
Would I have to apply for non-profit status?  I have so many questions and really don't know where to start to find out my legal liability.

Dear Jeb,

I believe it is the closed minded ignorance of you, your family and 
colleagues which make the world a more dangerous place. I cannot fathom that 
someone who has benefitted from an education could believe that isolation is 
the key to safety. Unfortunately the USA is one of the most contested places 
in the world. Some love it, but many are appalled at the absolute ignorance 
which abounds all 52 states.

No country has benefitted from isolation. However I believe that the 
isolation you wish to bestow on your country men is more sinister than pure 
cultural protection and homeland security. By creating an electorate 
ignorant to the world and knowledgable of only their ways you are guaranteed 
a vote. You espouse the need for protection, you harbour their fears of the 
other and you keep them in line by denying them the greatest gift- 
knowledge.

I hope you fail in your bid to protect Florida from the outside world, 
because it is such rash acts which lead to catastrophy. Acts of violence, 
violence perpetuated by people like you. Violence which effects innocent 
people.

I doubt very much that you will receive this email and I very much doubt 
that I would receive a reply. I am not deterred by this, because I know that 
I have attempted to take a step toward peace. I care more for individual 
well being than your huge agenda which not only allows, but needs for human 
suffering in order for people like you to profit.


You disgust me

Sincerely

Brigid Vidler


I hope the goabroad campaign has led to your inbox being inundated with 
angry mail. I hope more that you are intelligent enough to pay attention.

You have been an awesome governor, and a true advocate of the people of Florida and our environment.  I can't remember  a greater friend to Florida. Having said that,  I hope that you will consider a run for the White House  in the future because  we need your leadership, commitment, brilliance  and love in these uncertain times. Thank you for all you do each day.  God bless you and your family.

Dear Mr. Miller:

Thank you for your e-mail regarding funds for Ariel's services. We
appreciate the opportunity to provide any possible assistance and
additional information which may help to address your concerns.

Earlier this year, the Agency began offering general revenue funds to
individuals who are on the waiting list for waiver services.   We started
with the individuals who had been waiting the longest and have successfully
offered these services to close to 5,000 individuals.  That is over and
above the 6,600 individuals we have enrolled from the  into waiver programs
this year.  Because we have had this general revenue funding to offer, we
will be able to assist in funding additional therapy services for Ariel.  I
have directed staff in the APD area office to contact you today to offer
funding to allow Ariel to begin receiving extra therapy hours.  We will
authorize these services for three months and will re-evaluate at the end
of the time to determine if that is a sufficient number of hours for her
physical and occupational therapy needs.

Attached to this email is a copy of the Agency's response to the OPPAGA
report on the  reported surplus referred to in your email.  I am not sure
you've had an opportunity to read it or have had access to it but I
encourage you to contact me with any questions you might have regarding
this issue.

Mr. Miller, I admire your continued efforts to assure that Ariel is given
the therapies she needs to make progress and allow her to eventually live a
rich, full life.  My best to you and Mrs. Miller.

Dear All,

Our daughter Ariel Miller desperately needs therapy for the next several
years.  Vicki and I have put our all (physically, mentally, and
financially) into getting Ariel to the point where she is today.  Unless
funding is available for Ariel to continue to receive therapy, we will have
to take a second mortgage on our home.  To make a long story short, we’ve
done everything possible (short of getting the media involved) to receive
assistance in providing therapy for Ariel.  While lots of people have
wanted to help, no one has been able to find funding for Ariel.

Several days ago I came across a very surprising report!   In report number
06-33 (http://www.oppaga.state.fl.us/reports/health/r06-33s.html) dated
March 2006, OPPAGA reported the following:

      The Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) experienced a
      substantial funding surplus in both the Developmental Disabilities
      Home and Community-Based Services Waiver ($58.4 million) and the
      Family and Supported Living Waiver ($25.4 million) programs in Fiscal
      Year 2004-05.

      The agency expects to have a $35.3 million surplus in Fiscal Year
      2005-06.

      The Number of Waiver Recipients Was Lower Each Month of Fiscal Year
      2004-05 Than in Fiscal Year 2003-04

      As a result of the $58.4 million surplus for the DD/HCBS Waiver in
      Fiscal Year 2004-05, the agency reverted $21 million to the state
      General Revenue Fund, which resulted in the state foregoing the
      opportunity to draw down $30.1 million in federal Medicaid matching
      funds.

      The agency also experienced a $25.4 million surplus in the Family and
      Supported Living Waiver in Fiscal Year 2004-05. As a result, the
      agency reverted $10.4 million to the state General Revenue Fund which
      resulted in the state foregoing the opportunity to draw down $15
      million in federal Medicaid matching funds.


Shelly Brantley (APD Director), in her letter to Gary R. VanLandingham
(OPPAGA Director) dated March 27, 2006 stated the following:

(Embedded image moved to file: pic24221.gif)

In light of the above, would someone please explain to me why I need to
accept the answer there are no funds for Ariel’s therapy?

I would appreciate if everyone would get together and establish a way to
fund Ariel’s therapy.

Thanks,
Mike

Good evening Governor Bush,
 
My name is Pamela James-Principal-Pinecrest Elementary School. As I close out my third year as principal, it is evident that this Reading First  school is consistently working toward improving the academic performance of it's students each year.  Our grade received=C (350).
 
This could not have been accomplished without the support of my district, local higher performing schools and other higher performing schools around the state of Florida.  I'd like to recognize these schools by name: Bond-Wesson (Leon) and Saturn Elementary (Brevard). The principals (Pam Hightower/Mike Miller) and their staff have willingly opened their schools to my staff and I in sharing effective strategies to support our school. These schools have been an answer to our prayers as we continue to work toward improving student performance to achieve a school grade of A.
 
As we plan to visit Wesson for the 3rd year and Saturn the second year, I am asking your support for Pinecrest by assisting me with a 2-3 minute taping to WELCOME new / returning staff and students back. Because 50% of our staff is new to Collier County and the state of Florida, I believe this would be a very appropriate and effective strategy for our school where teacher retention is a challenge for this Immokalee, FL school. 
 
I am  more than willing to coordinate your busy schedule with my schedule as we plan for the 06-07 school year. Therefore I look forward to hearing from your office about coordinating this event in Tallahassee, FL.  Our school team will be visiting Bond/Wesson this summer possibly July 3rd.
Thank you for your support in this worthwhile endeavour as we continue making student learning a PRIORITY!  Thank you for being my Governor and I am PROUD to say JEB BUSH is my Governor!!
 
Sincerely,
Pamela James- 239-438-5052(school cell)  239-657-6373(home)

Sir,

Response from Mrs. Murray. I still expect you’ll hear something about this since she sent her initial inquiry out to the Governor’s office and probably state and local Congressmen as well as others. I’ll keep you posted should I have any additional contact with her.

Commander, 

 

Thank you for your expeditious response to our inquiry!

 

I, as I'm certain the other wives and families, appreciate your time in providing the information below. I will forward your communication on to those on the initial email.

 

Although I am concerned about the well-being of and communication to our families at home, my primary concern is for the soldiers on the deployment. As my husband and I have been discussing his upcoming re-enlistment, I do not believe we will continue our service with the Florida National Guard. However, should our decision change, I will strongly consider applying for a position in the FRG.

 

Thank you for Major Borowicz's contact information! Should anything arise between now and the unit's departure, we will facilitate correspondence through him.

 

Warm Regards, 

 

 

Linda Murray

Dear Mrs. Murray,

Thank you for your inquiry concerning Headquarters, 3-116th’s redeployment and your concern regarding the lack of communication received from the Family Readiness Group (FRG) recently.

 

As you should be aware, we are on a one-year deployment that began the day we arrived in Kuwait in August of last year. We will depart within a few days of the one-year anniversary of our arrival. We don’t have a specific date of our departure yet, but we expect that it will be very close to our 365th day of deployment. The specific date and time is still unknown and once known will be passed on to family members with operational security in mind. We will be sending out a newsletter within the next couple of weeks explaining the redeployment timeline, but the actual date of departure won’t be known until the very last minute for mission security and the safety of our troops. 

 

I do have some good news to share with you. We will be redeploying through Fort Stewart, Georgia instead of Camp Atterbury, Indiana and families will be able to welcome their Soldiers home at Ft. Stewart. We will spend approximately 5-7 days at Fort Stewart with the emphasis being on out processing from active duty before we return as a unit to Plant City for a short welcome home ceremony prior to final release. 

 

Our FRG coordinator did step down a few months ago and we have been actively seeking a replacement. It is a time-consuming and sometimes very stressful volunteer position that we have had trouble filling. Would you like to consider applying for a position in the FRG? Your obvious skill as a spokesperson for the families and in communication would be a real benefit to our families. We have canvassed the family members of our deployed soldiers and we haven’t had any takers. In the absence of a volunteer, MAJ Fred Borowicz, the Battalion’s Rear Detachment Commander, has been facilitating communication with the deployed unit family members from the armory in Plant City. You can reach him by phone at (813) 757-9045 or email frederick.h.borowicz@us.army.mil. He is always ready to assist the families in any way possible and has a lot of resources at his disposal.

 

Your husband has been doing a great job and he is doing very well. He has become an expert in customer service and support and has been a valuable member of our team. He works out every day and is always teaching and working with other soldiers on physical fitness and weight training. He has also taught martial arts to Soldiers here on Camp Virginia. I know your family, as well as all of our families, have made a tremendous sacrifice over the past 13 months. I can’t thank you enough for your sacrifice and the support you have shown for your Soldier. Please hang in there a couple more months. We’ll be home before you know it and you’ll be reunited with your husband. We’ve still got an important job to do here and need to stay focused on the mission at hand. Please forward this message to all of the people you copied your email to. Take care and I look forward to seeing you at our Homecoming. May God bless you and the United States of America.

 

Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I have been carefully considering this for a while and I decided to write to you about what I feel is what is one of your best strengths.
 
I know you wish to be considered the Education governor but, you are so gifted with your handling of the eight hurricanes that have hit Florida in the last two years.  I'd hate to see this talent go to waste.
 
You mobilized the federal, state, and local agencies that needed to be activated to deal with the situation.  You got on television and radio to tell the people of Florida what was happening and what they can do to help themselves.  You even addressed the Spanish-speaking population (and I for one app auld for this) in Spanish so that they knew what was going on.  There was a signer for the deaf population as well.  Your calm reassurance that there was help on its way.  Your handling of the run on gasoline was showed strength of character.  Your directive for generators for gas stations and supermarkets is reassuring; of course, there'll probably be a run on them.  Your planning for reverse directions for the Interstates is innovative and other states have now followed this idea.
 
Since Florida is the only state that has met the criteria for disaster preparedness, I'd hate to see your gift wasted.  Certainly there must be a way that you can serve at the federal or state level to prepare for disasters such as Florida has had in the last two years.
 
I don't know how you would do it but, somehow I think it would be in the best interests of the state if not the country to form a disaster-readiness organization at the state cabinet-level,  committee, or whatever where this talent could be best utilized.  In other words, don't just buy a football team and I hope that I'm not the only one who feels this way!

Dear President Bush, 
I wanted to clarify exactly what I know I could do for You, and our Country - Per my “E” mail to you below! 
I feel that I have been blessed with the ability to speak to people and really reach them “inside”.  I have traveled all around our Country and the World for my job, and I have met many different people from all walks of life.  I know am able to “connect” with each one in an honest and memorable way.  I have diffused tense situations between Companies of different Nationalities, etc…  I KNOW MY TALENT COULD BE PUT TO USE IN A BROADER WAY!
I would very much like to try and help bring some peace to warn torn areas of the world, by acting as a negotiator/moderator on behalf of You and our Country.  NO, I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE ANYONE’S CURRENT JOB!  I would work with your People, who you have doing such things today.
I know all religions have one universal theme; that of worshiping A/One God.  Muslims, Christians, Jews (I know there is more religions) all believe in the goodness and omniscience of God.  The foundation of all religions is based on the fundamental belief that MAN should be Kind to others, and should NOT harm of kill others!  I know, many of the people who are at war with one another need/MUST be reminded of how “alike” Men/Women are!   
How can a man like myself, who SINCERELY wants to help (I do not want money, fame, press, NOTHING LIKE THIS!), make a difference in this World?  I know I can!  By offering You/Our Country, the talents I have, (that have worked in a Global Business Market) I KNOW I CAN HELP!   I would like to work with the individuals you already have “in place”, as a moderator.
Mr. President, I feel a very STRONG “Calling” at this point in my life.  I want to attempt, as I know this will NOT be easy, to reach out to others in our Country/World!   Sir, all I’m asking for is a chance!
Thank you for your time in reading the above, and below “E” mails.  (Personally, I can’t stand these things, but, I know I have to keep up with “Technology”)
Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern, 
I know you probably get millions of “E” mails a day from around the world, to the President; however, if you could PLEASE make sure you try and have someone read this, so it gets to the President, I would greatly appreciate it.  I’ve tried to highlight this “E” mail so it sticks out among others, hopefully its working????  I guess I won’t know until I hear back from someone, but, if you could PLEASE try and have someone read this, I would really appreciate it!!!
Dear Mr. President, 
I hope this “E” mail finds you well, as I know you are a very busy person, in fact I don’t know how in the heck you do it!!  I just have a small Company outside Detroit, and I can barley hold it together.
I wanted to do something for my Country, and You, and promised some individuals I would try to contact you.   No, I’m just an average guy, making it through the day, but I made a VERY BIG PROMISE to these “individuals”, that I would try and contact you.  Hell, I don’t even know if you’re reading this, or if someone is reading it to you.  I just wanted to ask you to remember some things:
1.      Take Care of yourself, you learned this in AA.  I am an alcoholic as well, and forget this all the time.  But, you know, as I do, we need to be healthy to keep pushing forward.  
2.      Take care of your family.  I believe you have two girls?  Remember, you brought them into this world, keep an eye on them, and of course your Wife is # 2.  George first, your Lovely wife, then your girls, then the Country!
Sir, I have many thoughts/ideas I would love to talk to you about, but, the biggest one is what is going on overseas right now.  Here are some thoughts:
As you know, everyone believes in “A” God.  You then have people, like you and I that believe in Jesus, the Jewish that don’t believe Jesus ever came, and then the people who believe in Mohamed.  Mr. President, have Ms Rice try to work this angle, if we all believe in A God, then why aren’t we behaving like we should?  Leave Jesus, and Mohamed out of her first meeting, just focus on getting them to admit they believe in A God, then have her move on from there.
Mr. President, remember: 
*       Jewish, don’t believe in Jesus, but believe in first 5 books of the bible, so Jewish and Christians have at least something in common. 
*       Muslims, they believe in Mohamed, and Mohamed said, “Treat people well”, and His words were told/written after Jesus died.  Plus, Mohamed talked about Jesus, so even though Muslims don’t believe in Jesus, Mohamed acknowledges that fact he was around back then.
*       Christian’s, we believe in the Bible, and Jesus, but we also believe in the first 5 books of the bible, so we are like Jewish People, and we have to accept that people may not believe in Jesus, but, Jesus told us to be kind to others, so let others do what they want.
All Three, and if there are more religions, I don’t know, have one thing in common.  We all believe in A God.  We all believe to treat people well.  I feel, if we can get some of the “leaders” to acknowledge this, we can move forward, and the Big Guy upstairs won’t be some upset with us, as he is now!
Shoot Sir, if we all get back to basics, and if we all truly believe in A God, then lets take it from there. Once we all get on the same page, we can start helping the poor, as God wants us to, but we have to work together to do this.  Easier said then done I know, but, I would do this for you, if you gave me the chance to, working with Ms Rice???  
Mr. President, I know I am shooting the moon”, trying to “E” mail you, but, I want to help You, our Country, and most important, I promised some “individuals”, I would send you this to you!
Can you, or have someone from your Staff let me know you at least read this, I would greatly appreciate it. 
You’re doing a great job Sir, but, you are only human, and NEVER forget that. 
Thanks Mr. President, and I look forward in “someone” getting back with me.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Thank you for the great work you are doing for the State of Florida.  
 
The Plein Aire Cottage Artists of Indian Rocks Beach have been capturing, in oil, on canvas, the historical cottages and homes of Indian Rocks Beach.  Their paintings are being grabbed up by collectors across the USA, Canada, Europe.   
 
Each year the artists create a calendar featuring their paintings of Indian Rocks Beach. This spectacular little seaside town is gaining notoriety throughout the world.
 
Mayor Bill Ockunzzi of Indian Rocks Beach did write your office about these painters in April 2006.
 
The Tampa Tribune featured the Plein Aire Cottage Artists in a two page colour feature in November 2005.
 
Fox TV Tampa Lloyd Sowers did a documentary of these artists and Indian Rocks Beach which was aired on February 14, 2006.(I understand it is being run periodically on an ongoing basis)
 
The Belleair Bee have featured these artists on a regular basis and did an Editorial on these three exceptional painters.
 
The Plein Aire Cottage Artists consists of 3 award winning artists: Violetta Shtumeyzen, a Russian born fifth generation artist, whose work is being collected in North America and Europe. Violetta teaches at Ringling Art School and the Gulf Coast Museum.   Mary Rose Holmes, a Florida native artist who holds a degree in fine art from Agnes Scott College and Helen Tilston an Irish born artist who captures the beauty of Indian Rocks Beach.
 
The Plein Aire Cottage Artists believe in giving back to their community.
 
Their donations to non profit organizations in 2006 were:
 
$4,500.00 to IRB Library and IRB Historical Museum
$2,400,00 to Indian Rocks Beach Action 2000.
$1,200.00 to the YMCA Indian Rocks Beach.  
 
For 2007, we plan on giving to these organizations once again. Our calendar depicting paintings of Indian Rocks Beach is at the printer.
 
The Plein Aire Cottage Artists web site is:  www.pleinaircottageartists.com
 
Our proposal is that the Plein Aire Cottage Artists exhibit at the Governor's Gallery in 2007.  
How would November 2007 work for you?
 
Please contact me for additional information.  I look forward to hearing from you.

This will be my first hurricane season as a retired senior season.  One of the reasons I retired was the tremendous workload I carried during Ivan and Dennis as well as Katrina.  I worked as support personnel with a major auto/boat insurer and while I was very proud of the job we did, it was stressful and tiring.  You must feel the same way sometimes.  So please accept my thanks and admiration for all you do to prepare, plan, respond and to provide a calming image to those of us with jittery nerves.  I wish you continued success in  all that you do.

NO, THIS IS NOT A PRANK “E” MAIL!!!!!!!!

I have also tried sending this to Mrs. Bush, Ms Rice, and Mr. Chaney this AM.  I know your Brother is at Camp David today and tomorrow, discussing matters that I KNOW I can help with!  Will you please get this to him as soon as you can this AM.

Thank you very much for your cooperation in this matter.

Importance: High

Dear President Bush,

I wanted to clarify exactly what I know I could do for You, and our Country - Per my “E” mail to you below!

I feel that I have been blessed with the ability to speak to people and really reach them “inside”.  I have traveled all around our Country and the World for my job, and I have met many different people from all walks of life.  I know am able to “connect” with each one in an honest and memorable way.  I have diffused tense situations between Companies of different Nationalities, etc…  I KNOW MY TALENT COULD BE PUT TO USE IN A BROADER WAY!

I would very much like to try and help bring some peace to warn torn areas of the world, by acting as a negotiator/moderator on behalf of You and our Country.  NO, I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE ANYONE'S CURRENT JOB!  I would work with your People, who you have doing such things today.

I know all religions have one universal theme; that of worshiping A/One God.  Muslims, Christians, Jews (I know there is more religions) all believe in the goodness and omniscience of God.  The foundation of all religions is based on the fundamental belief that MAN should be Kind to others, and should NOT harm of kill others!  I know, many of the people who are at war with one another need/MUST be reminded of how “alike” Men/Women are!   

How can a man like myself, who SINCERELY wants to help (I do not want money, fame, press, NOTHING LIKE THIS!), make a difference in this World?  I know I can!  By offering You/Our Country, the talents I have, (that have worked in a Global Business Market) I KNOW I CAN HELP!   I would like to work with the individuals you already have “in place”, as a moderator.

Mr. President, I feel a very STRONG “Calling” at this point in my life.  I want to attempt, as I know this will NOT be easy, to reach out to others in our Country/World!   Sir, all I'm asking for is a chance!

Thank you for your time in reading the above, and below “E” mails.  (Personally, I can't stand these things, but, I know I have to keep up with “Technology”)

Sincerely,

Cranston G. Jones Sr.

Importance: High

To Whom It May Concern,

I know you probably get millions of “E” mails a day from around the world, to the President; however, if you could PLEASE make sure you try and have someone read this, so it gets to the President, I would greatly appreciate it.  I've tried to highlight this “E” mail so it sticks out among others, hopefully its working????  I guess I won't know until I hear back from someone, but, if you could PLEASE try and have someone read this, I would really appreciate it!!!

Dear Mr. President,

I hope this “E” mail finds you well, as I know you are a very busy person, in fact I don't know how in the heck you do it!!  I just have a small Company outside Detroit, and I can barley hold it together.

I wanted to do something for my Country, and You, and promised some individuals I would try to contact you.   No, I'm just an average guy, making it through the day, but I made a VERY BIG PROMISE to these “individuals”, that I would try and contact you.  Hell, I don't even know if you're reading this, or if someone is reading it to you.  I just wanted to ask you to remember some things:

1.	Take Care of yourself, you learned this in AA.  I am an alcoholic as well, and forget this all the time.  But, you know, as I do, we need to be healthy to keep pushing forward.  

2.	Take care of your family.  I believe you have two girls?  Remember, you brought them into this world, keep an eye on them, and of course your Wife is # 2.  George first, your Lovely wife, then your girls, then the Country!

Sir, I have many thoughts/ideas I would love to talk to you about, but, the biggest one is what is going on overseas right now.  Here are some thoughts:

As you know, everyone believes in “A” God.  You then have people, like you and I that believe in Jesus, the Jewish that don't believe Jesus ever came, and then the people who believe in Mohamed.  Mr. President, have Ms Rice try to work this angle, if we all believe in A God, then why aren't we behaving like we should?  Leave Jesus, and Mohamed out of her first meeting, just focus on getting them to admit they believe in A God, then have her move on from there.

Mr. President, remember:

*	Jewish, don't believe in Jesus, but believe in first 5 books of the bible, so Jewish and Christians have at least something in common. 

*	Muslims, they believe in Mohamed, and Mohamed said, “Treat people well”, and His words were told/written after Jesus died.  Plus, Mohamed talked about Jesus, so even though Muslims don't believe in Jesus, Mohamed acknowledges that fact he was around back then.

*	Christian's, we believe in the Bible, and Jesus, but we also believe in the first 5 books of the bible, so we are like Jewish People, and we have to accept that people may not believe in Jesus, but, Jesus told us to be kind to others, so let others do what they want.

All Three, and if there are more religions, I don't know, have one thing in common.  We all believe in A God.  We all believe to treat people well.  I feel, if we can get some of the “leaders” to acknowledge this, we can move forward, and the Big Guy upstairs won't be some upset with us, as he is now!

Shoot Sir, if we all get back to basics, and if we all truly believe in A God, then lets take it from there. Once we all get on the same page, we can start helping the poor, as God wants us to, but we have to work together to do this.  Easier said then done I know, but, I would do this for you, if you gave me the chance to, working with Ms Rice???  

Mr. President, I know I am shooting the moon”, trying to “E” mail you, but, I want to help You, our Country, and most important, I promised some “individuals”, I would send you this to you!

Can you, or have someone from your Staff let me know you at least read this, I would greatly appreciate it.

You're doing a great job Sir, but, you are only human, and NEVER forget that.

Thanks Mr. President, and I look forward in “someone” getting back with me.

Sincerely,

Cranston G. Jones

P.S.  I would love to meet, if you ever had one hour, to talk!!!!!

Dear Governor, 

 

My name is Cynthia Romero-Revels and I desperately need your help!! I need to bring to your attention a great injustice in Polk County, FL.  I won't take much of your time and I will quickly try to tell you my story.  In 1994 my father, Mariano Romero and soon-to-be step father, Scott Mitchell were murdered within two months of each other.  My father's murderer, Delfino Garza, is still sitting in a Florida prison.  Justice was served for my father but Scott's murderer is about to be set free!  The following article tells about this great injustice to our society.  In the article is also a case summary of how this case has played out over the last twelve years.  You are my last hope.  Please do not let this monster be set free!!!  This man is slipping through the holes in our justice system. Can you please do whatever it takes to keep this man in jail?  You are a wonderful governor and I have always admired you and I am sure you will do what you can.  Thanks for your time.

 

Sincerely,

Cynthia Romero-Revels

Moody Won't Face New Trial in Slaying



By Jason Geary <javascript:NewWindow(376,130,'/apps/pbcs.dll/personalia?ID=jasgea&category=STAFF');> 
The Ledger

BARTOW -- Darryl Earl Moody is expected to go free, ending what has been more than 12 years of legal battles in a murder case filled with twists and turns.

The 2nd District Court of Appeal in Lakeland ruled Wednesday that Moody should not go to trial for a third time for first-degree murder in the 1994 fatal shooting of Scott Mitchell, a member of a prominent Bartow citrus family.

The court also concluded that Moody, 44, of Lake Wales, couldn't be retried for a lesser crime of third-degree murder.

Moody's lawyer, Robert Norgard, said his client is trying to let the court's opinion sink in. "He is extremely happy that the court finally ruled and ruled in his favor," he said.

Norgard said the 2nd DCA's opinion in the Moody case concerns a fundamental constitutional right protecting people from "double jeopardy."

Looking back over the case's long history, Norgard said it has "been through some major procedural steps compared to a lot of other cases."

"I would definitely say the system has worked the way it is supposed to work," he said. "Unfortunately, it's a slow process."

Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist's office can request a rehearing, but the 2nd DCA's ruling seems to leave little room for argument.

"My fear is that this is the end of the road . . ." said State Attorney Jerry Hill.

Although disappointed upon hearing news of the opinion, Hill said he respected it.

"Objectively speaking, we are obliged to follow the law and the courts have told us what the law is," he said.

Hill said prosecutors have been committed to going forward in the case even as court decisions "nibbled away" at available evidence.

Scott Mitchell, 32, was fatally shot on May 16, 1994.

Investigators concluded that Mitchell, who was preparing to check on harvesting crews, was ambushed in a grove maintained by his family near Alturas.

Mitchell was shot while trying to back out of the grove in his red Chevrolet pickup truck. He had been shot twice in the head with two different weapons.

One weapon, a Rossi .38-caliber revolver, would later be recovered from a man who said he bought the handgun from Moody for $60. The second murder weapon has never been found.

Prosecutors theorize that Darryl Moody and his younger brother, Dexter, were stripping a stolen, green Buick Regal inside the grove when Mitchell surprised them. However, Dexter Moody has never been charged in Mitchell's death.

In 1998, a jury found Moody guilty of first-degree murder and related charges. He was sentenced to death.

About four years later, the Florida Supreme Court overturned Moody's conviction and sentence because of an illegal search of his car. A new trial was ordered.

In 2004, a second jury convicted Moody of third-degree murder but acquitted him of other charges. Shortly afterward, allegations of juror misconduct surfaced.

After conducting interviews with the second trial's jurors, Circuit Judge Susan Roberts concluded "an atmosphere of racial tension in the jury room prevented meaningful deliberations from taking place."

Roberts -- who has presided over Moody's case since his first trial in 1998 -- noted that one juror bullied other jurors by calling them racists.

She later ordered a new trial, saying the verdicts reached by the second jury were nullified.

Roberts described the situation as being somewhat similar to a mistrial, where a defendant can be tried on the same charges.

But the 2nd DCA disagreed with her.

"Moody's trial was not terminated by a declaration of a mistrial," the DCA opinion states. "It ended with a verdict convicting him of one lesser-included offense and acquitting him of all other charges."

The three-judge DCA panel -- consisting of Stevan T. Northcutt, James W. Whatley and Darryl C. Casanueva -- released its detailed, 12-page opinion Wednesday.

In addition, prosecutors won't be able to retry Moody for third-degree murder because the second jury has acquitted him of grand theft, which would be needed to prove the lesser murder charge.

A member of the Mitchell family said Wednesday the news of the opinion has been devastating for them.

Mitchell's brother, Roy Dan Mitchell, said his family has respect and compassion for capital crime victims, their families, law enforcement, the State Attorney's Office and trial judges.

But he said the Mitchell family has little compassion or respect for the Florida Supreme Court, the 2nd DCA and even less for the jurors in the second trial.

"We are just very saddened that our judicial system seems to be crumbling from the top," Mitchell said. "In business, when that happens, you will not succeed for long."

He said when his father, W.B. "Preacher" Mitchell, died from cancer in 1996, Moody faced the death penalty.

Now, Moody, who is being held in the Polk County Jail, appears to be going free.

"My brother, Scott, and his loved ones have no closure, no hope and no justice," Roy Dan Mitchell said. "Decidedly, it's a damn sad day for all of us law-abiding citizens."

Windstorm Insurance May Be Problem as Hurricane Season Begins


June 12, 2006 

U.S. commercial real estate (CRE) values in coastal areas, and in particular smaller multifamily properties, may suffer as insurance companies reduce loss exposure to hurricane-prone areas by increasing premiums, raising deductibles, dropping coverage amounts and even dropping coverage altogether following the most active and most expensive hurricane season in 2005, according to Fitch Ratings.

"CMBS servicers have noticed a sharp increase of anywhere between 25 percent and 400 percent in windstorm and flood insurance premiums since the official start of the hurricane season on June 1,'"said Joseph Kelly, Senior Director, Fitch Ratings. "This may present a problem for commercial real estate properties where premium increases cannot be passed through to tenants, and in fact the resulting value decline may be severe enough so a property can no longer support its full debt service, increasing the likelihood of payment default."

As premiums increase, and in some cases even skyrocket, the same is happening to deductibles, as Fitch has seen increases of 10 percent to 15 percent of replacement value for renewals, compared to 2 percent to 5 percent last year. Some CMBS servicers are requiring borrowers to provide guarantees to cover the difference between the two deductibles to mitigate the additional risk.

With some insurers placing caps on windstorm coverage and even dropping coverage all together active, "Fitch's chief concern is that windstorm insurance along coastal areas may become commercially unavailable, possibly echoing in severity the terrorism insurance issues of late 2001/early 2002," said Senior Director Patty Bach.

Key questions arose after Katrina, as much damage was caused by flooding, not by wind. Almost all residential property and casualty (P&C) windstorm policies specifically exclude damage caused by flooding (including storm surges), and have so for many years. Since private insurance companies were largely unwilling to underwrite and bear the risk of flood because of its catastrophic nature, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created in the late-1960s to provide insurance coverage for flood damage.

Unlike the residential insurance market, many commercial P&C insurance policies are negotiated contracts and therefore may or may not cover flood damage depending on the terms of the individual policy. Some standard commercial property policy will provide excess flood coverage after a NFIP policy. NFIP insurance not only provides primary coverage, but also helps lower premiums and increase availability of excess flood coverage in the private market. Currently, NFIP flood coverage on commercial properties is capped at $500,000 for the building and an additional $500,000 can be purchased to cover a buildings contents. Congress is currently working on proposed changes to the NFIP, which among other things would increase the current coverage limits. NFIP policies currently do not cover business interruption insurance.

Mortgages secured in CMBS typically carry P&C insurance coverage equal to the replacement cost of the property. The majority of P&C insurance policies include wind as a covered peril, except for properties located in close proximity to the coast. Close proximity definitions differ by insurance companies and their risk appetite. For example, some insurance companies exclude wind for properties located within 20 miles of the coast, others 100 miles. When wind is excluded, a separate wind policy or rider needs to be purchased.

Fitch plans to host a forum to further explore the issues surrounding windstorm insurance and the potential impact on the CMBS market.

You are a man of high moral values and an excellent role model for young people.  I greatly admire you and what you have done and are doing for your state.  If you are not going to run for the office of President would you please consider moving to Tennessee and running for governor here?  You are a true example of what the Republican Party is and should be about.  In this day of ugly, corrupt politicians you are a breath of fresh air.  Thank you for being such a good person.

Gov. Bush,

I have a great aunt that currently resides in an assisted living home. We
believe that she is now in the first stage of Alzheimer's. My problem is
healthcare, she does not make enough money to stay in her current residence
but makes to much money to qualify for Medicaid. What program(s) does she
qualify for that will assist us with this problem? Financially I am not
able to assist her without neglecting my own families needs. As you may or
may not know Alzheimer's is a very expensive disease. I am trying to find
help now before I find myself in a financial bind or become buried in
bureaucratic paperwork trying to get financial help. Thank you for your
help and keep up the excellent work.

Very respectfully,
Chad Ream

Beth,
I regret to say that we will not be adopting the little girl from Miami.  We feel that Camelot or whoever makes the rules about homestudies is ridiculous.  If this was the first time we had adopted, we might be able to understand why we need to jump through so many hoops.  However, if our homestudy was good enough for another country and the U.S. Immigration services it should be good enough for Hillsborough Co.  It was also good enough for the Charlee Adoption Unit in Miami.  Now, I understand why so  many people  choose to adopt 
internationally.  It is much less complicated and less stressful.  It is truly a shame that the system wants to make it so difficult for families to adopt.  
I have done some research and if one family in every church would adopt one child there would be no more children in foster care.  I know several families in our church that would be willing to do that however, they have been given false information about children that they have fostered or planned to adopt.  So, most of them no longer desire to work with the system as do we.  My heart truly goes out to these children that are languishing in care.  The fact is that they will be on government assistance when they turn eighteen because they will not have a family to turn to.  So, we will be paying for them out of our tax dollars.  Why not make it a little easier to adopt and maybe these children could have a chance.  I know exactly what goes on in the system because I used to work for CHS as an adoptions recruiter.  I could not get case managers to work with me even when I had families that would adopt sibling groups and children of different races.  The supervisors were even worse.  They would never reply to my messages or answer their phones.  I still have families from FOUR YEARS AGO calling  me  from the other side of the state asking me to help them because CHS will not return their phone calls.  That is so sad!  I really feel sorry for those that make the rules.  Someday we will all have to stand before God and explain ourselves.  Matthew 25: 44-46 "Then they will reply, "Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you? And he will answer, "I assure you, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me."  And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life."  I would hate to the one that has not helped the least of these.  
My husband and I are not satisfied with the outcome of our simple request.  We would like to know who your supervisor is so that we can move forward.  We do not want anymore children kept out of homes because the system chooses to make things more difficult.  We are ready to contact the news media because someone has to take a stand for these children.
 
Sincerely,
Terri and Mike Campbell

Dear Governor Bush,

We need your help with an adoption. We are in the process of attempting to adopt a 10 year-old little girl from Miami through the Charlee Adoption Unit. The Charlee Adoption Unit has been wonderful. That said, our problem is with Hillsborough Co. We have a current homestudy that was completed by Commonwealth Adoption International, Inc. (a state licensed agency) and is valid until July 2006. Hillsborough Co. and Camelot will not accept this homestudy and want to do a completely new homestudy. We have adopted four children and have five biological children. We feel that they are having control issues and wanting to spend tax payers dollars when Commonwealth is willing to come out and update the study and have it ready in two weeks. Whereas, Camelot will not have the study ready for a minimum of two months. The child in question does not have two months. She is in a theraputic home and has lost her placement there as of May 13, 2006. However, the Charlee Adoption Unit has gotten a short extension for her so that she will not have to be moved to another foster placement before transitioning to our home as an adoptive placement. We contacted Jeanne Tate, attorney at law and she referred us to Steve Herwitz who contacted Camelot on our behalf to request that they allow us to use Commonwealth to update the study and again they refused. The contract case manager from Camelot came to our home on Saturday May 20, 2006 and requested unbelievable amounts of information and was here for four and one-half hours. She barely acknowledged our children and focused on my history for the past 47 years. Then, she stated that she would have to come back and interview my husband and children. So, to make a long story short, we are not happy with the system here and would like this issue resolved quickly so that another child will not lose her adoptive placement because of the system. This has been an ongoing problem with Hillsborough Co. and I am sure that I could get a list of several signatures of families that have given up on the prospect of adoption due to the system.. The whole purpose of the adoptive system is to place children in homes. Is it not? I am very concerned that the system will eventually fall apart and what will become of these children? That is why we chose to adopt our last three children from Liberia. We had hoped and prayed that the system would have improved over the past four years and we decided to try again. Because we feel that this is what we are lead to do and it is definitiely NOT the children's fault that the system is falling apart. I will be happy to discuss this matter with you further if you would like to call my number is 813-651-9800. We would appectiate any assistance that you can give to expedite this matter.

Subject: My Parent Safety and Medicare Complaint
Desk of Governor Jeb Bush,
I am sending this email on behalf of my mother who is a resident of the State of Florida and a Senior Citizen in her late 70’s.
As well as my father who is of the same. 
My mother had back surgery a few weeks ago, and of course due to her age, she has her limitations, but quite capable as long has her strength holds up. This leads me to the reason for this email.
My father had knee replacement surgery 2 weeks ago, and is now home recovering. This recovery includes a therapist and medical assistant aide thru Medicare. The therapist has been exceptional.  
Unfortunately the experience wit the Medicare medical assistant aide has been a nightmare. From the initial meeting when the aide came to the wrong door, and my mother informed her she needed to enter from the other door, and the aided stating no, telling my mother to open the other door, well per my mother, it was only the beginning of a day from hell for her.  My mother asked the assistant to help her change the bed, and the assistant refused, stating it was not in her job description. She was sent to assist with my father, bath him etc. 
The request to help change the bed was due to the accidents my father has been having in bed, requiring the bed to be changed daily. The accidents are direct / indirect results of the surgery, medication.  The assistant not only refused to help, she was rude and verbally abusive with my mother. My mother told her she wanted her out of the house, she refused, stayed in the house and called her supervisor on her own cell phone, but still in my parent's home and  she continued to complain about my mother and how rude my mother to whoever she called on the phone, who she stated was her supervisor.… 
My mother still wanted her out of the house, and she still refused.  My mother in the mean time, unable to get this woman to leave, used her own phone and contacted the medical POC who had arranged for the Medicare aide. 
She was appalled by the report my mother provided. My mother reported the aide’s rudeness, her unprofessionalism, and that fact that she was also concerned over the aide’s excessively long fingernails and the concerns she had with regards to causing injury to her husband/ my father while bathing, and or unable to secure her husband while bathing him. 
My mother was informed, there was no one else, that they were short staffed.  This to me is unacceptable and hard to believe, if a patient is concerned about being safe in her own home, the Medicare office should be required to investigate and provide alternate coverage, and take the call as a serious issue to be addressed immediately.  
I can’t believe the State of Florida, or even the Medicare system would take a chance at putting their citizens/patients at risk like that. 
Bottom line the Medicare aide sent to assist my mother with my Dad was inadequate and posed as a safety concern for my parents, and a real threat to my mother with her refusal to leave the house.
This aide’s refusal to leave my parent’s house and them both being elderly in their late 70’s is a real concern for me as well with regards to their safety and any senior citizen this employee may be sent to.  
I am appalled that the State of Florida would allow such behavior by their caregivers, or disregard any complaint by a senior citizens stating they are not being treated properly, and does not investigate immediately.
As a Contract Surveillance Rep for the DOD myself, I find it very hard to believe the State of Florida would ignore any such complaints. Hopefully this is an isolated incident, but my guess it’s not. I hope you take notice of this email and address this problem with Medicare and the quality of the individuals hired to care for our elderly.
For the Record, I have included my parents name and address and phone number, hoping someone from your office will call them and acknowledge this email and show some compassion with regards to the treatment of our elderly thru Medicare and any other programs where aides, caregivers are sent to individuals homes. 
As I do not live in Florida, and I hoped and prayed with my parents living in a retirement community with Security would be a security blanket for us, knowing they were looked out for. 
But now, my concerns have resurfaced.  Please look into this matter.  My other concern would also be retaliation towards my parents by the employee for submitting such a complaint, since she knows where they live and quite aware of their limitations.
Thank you for listening, and I look forward to your response, but more importantly, you immediate attention to this matter to prevent it in the future.

Dear Governor Bush,
    Thank you for signing into law the A++ educational plan.  I am an 8th grade American History teacher and I am so pleased to see that the new plan requires middle school students to pass science and social studies classes.  It has been so frustrating to hear students and parents (and even guidance counselors) say things like, "I don't have to pass this class," and "Your class isn't important." 
    I also wanted to tell you that I feel very sad thinking about the fact that your time as governor of Florida is nearing its end.  I think you are the best governor this state has ever had and no one will be able to replace you. Thank you so much for your service to our state and I hope your brother offers you a terrific job at the national level-and maybe someday you'll consider running for president yourself!

Hello Governor Bush, my name is Shane Cleveland.
I'm a 19 year-old native Floridian, and I never did get the chance to vote for you. So instead, I hope that this e-mail makes up in some way for that fact.
I just wanted to thank you for your work on the behalf of our beautiful state. I know that you probably hear more criticism than thanks in such a public job, and I wanted to thank you for being steady and consistent through many challenges in fighting for the health of our state, whether economically, socially, culturally, or otherwise.
I want you to know that your work is truly appreciated, and that I am praying for you and your family for whatever future God has planned for you. I am proud to tell my out-of-state friends that you're my Governor, and I am sad that I will no longer have that opportunity after this year ends. (Although I am glad that you can go on vacation for longer than 10 days for the first time, like you were telling Frank Barnes in the Weekly Standard!)
God Bless!
Your younger brother in Christ and fellow Floridian, 
Shane Cleveland

Hi Carolyn: 

Would you please review the attached draft documents regarding proclamation style, formatting, and routing for the proclamations to be signed by the Governor?  I would appreciate your comments and corrections.

I used the hepatitis proclamation as the example and the Office of Citizens' Services Correspondence Manual.  I noted in the signed proclamation that the body text appears to be justified rather than left-aligned, as indicated in the manual for letters.  I was not sure which alignment to use so went with what was in the manual.  If that is not correct, please let me know.

As I explained previously, we are developing a departmental style guide, which will include these attachments.  I appreciate  any and all assistance with ensuring we have our information correct. Thank you!

I am a concerned citizen who has been informed of the unfortunate events surrounding Leah Schoick and her case. As owner of a graphic design company in South Florida, I have been involved with Missing Children International Ministries for the past year. When ever the missing families have needed the help of my business, they were given it in the best way possible. I am sad to hear that our police departments cannot say the same. Although I do not have children, I dread to think that if I did, among the fight to find my missing child would be the fight to get officials to keep the case open. Leah Schoick is a human being who deserves to have officials fighting for her. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE UP ON HER! You will be sending out a message to all missing children and their families if you do. Cases should remain open for 100 years after the missing date. Please re-assign Leah's case to a detective who really cares. I am asking that you show your concern and willingness to participate by meeting with Dinorah Perry, the Director of Missing Children International Ministries.
 
None of us have given up on her, so niether should you!
We will continue to fight for Leah and we will remember the decision you come to during this time!

I just wanted to thank you for all of the wonderful work you have done and inspired in our state.  I am a missionary working in Peru, South America with the Deaf.  I love Florida and would still be living and serving there in Southwest Florida if God had not called me to the mission field.  It is still my permanent state of residence.  

 

I was raised in Tampa.  After serving six years in the Navy, I had the honor of serving as a Deputy Sheriff in Lee County, Florida as well as an Asst. Pastor in two churches in the Ft. Myers area prior to becoming a missionary.  

 

I read Fred Barnes article in the Weekly Standard and thought it would be good to let you know that I appreciated you and pray that God will continue to give you wisdom for the future (By the way, their cover picture did not do you justice!).  

 

Florida is a much better and vibrant state that exemplifies its motto thanks to the leadership, vision and excellent stewardship that you and your leadership team have provided.  

 

Once again, thank you for your dedicated and thoughtful public service.  You have shown yourself to be a public servant, not just a politician.  Others would do well to learn from and emulate your leadership.  I voted for you three times.  Should you decide to seek public office again in the future, you will again have my vote.

Dear Mr. Bush and Family:
 
I am so sorry to hear about your dog.  I am sure that he had a great life and a lot of love during it.   Per the picture that was in our paper showed a very a pretty dog.  
 
Our dog is almost 13 (cocker spaniel/dachshund mix) and this last week has been very, very sad.  He too is probably near the end of his life and I can't even imagine what life will be without him.  
 
Our dog, Chipper, is my first dog, and I am assuming will be our last dog; I have learned how much part of the family they really do become!!  
 
I think it is very endearing that your dog was named after your brother.   I think that has to be a great honor!!  
 
I wish you all the best and keep those precious memories alive.

The text version of the e-newsletter is below.


ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BILL PACKAGE SIGNED INTO LAW

On Tuesday, I signed a series of bold new economic development initiatives
to bolster Florida's Innovation Economy. The new legislation creates the
21st Century Technology, Research, and Scholarship Enhancement Act, the
Innovation Incentive Program, and Space Florida, and provides significant
tax exemptions for machinery and equipment used for research and development
and manufacturing. During times of abundance, it is smart to reinvest some
of these one-time revenues back into our economy to attract capital
investment and create high wage jobs that, in turn, generate recurring
revenue for state and local government. 


MARTIN LEE ANDERSON ACT SIGNED INTO LAW

On Wednesday, I signed the Martin Lee Anderson Act, creating Sheriff's
Training and Respect (STAR) academies and implementing policies and
procedures to ensure the safety of the youth being served. I commend the
Florida Legislature for reforming our state's juvenile justice system. These
reforms provide programs that will help juvenile offenders turn their lives
around and the tools they need for a successful future. 


HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE AND RECOVERY LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW

On Thursday, I signed a series of bills to provide historic state funding
for hurricane preparedness, response and recovery. These measures will
significantly enhance Florida's ability to prepare for hurricanes, respond
quickly after a storm, recover from impacts to the economy, and mitigate
future threats to public safety and infrastructure. I applaud the Florida
Legislature for passing comprehensive legislation and providing
unprecedented funding to help Florida's families and communities. As we
enter the 2006 Hurricane Season, I strongly urge all Floridians to continue
preparing their homes and families for the coming months. 


BACK-TO-SCHOOL SALES TAX HOLIDAY BILL SIGNED INTO LAW

On Thursday, I encouraged Floridians and out-of-state shoppers alike to take
advantage of the state's sales tax holiday, which runs Saturday July 22nd
until midnight on July 30th. The sales tax holiday includes books, clothing,
footwear and certain school supplies. I am delighted that millions of
Floridians will again have the opportunity to save money during the sales
tax holiday, and am particularly pleased that shoppers will again be able to
save money on books. Reading is a critical part of lifelong learning and
success, and the sales tax holiday is a great way for families to save money
while encouraging reading. 


STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BILL SIGNED INTO LAW

On Friday, I signed HB 795, which creates the First Generation Matching
Grant Program and appropriates $6.5 million for state universities for the
program. Under the bill, the state will provide matching funds to state
universities and community colleges to provide scholarships to students who
are the first in their family to attend college and earn a bachelor's
degree. HB 1237, signed into law earlier this week, also provides $5 million
for community colleges for the program. I thank the members of the Florida
Legislature for working with us to ensure students are able to pursue a
college education and overcome financial obstacles. Now, students will have
an opportunity to pursue and reach their dreams of a higher education.

First let me extend mine and other friends sypmathy on the passing of Marvin.  He will be truly missed by not only you and your family, but by the Florida people who came to adore him.  I am writing to let you know that I have added Marvin to the Pets Bridgelist, as Pet Loss.com.  This is a place where pet owners share their grief and remember their pets each Monday night.  The Monday night Candle Ceremony will now include Marvin, and he will not be forgotten.  A gentleman started this site and it has grown and grown.  Myself and other friends have added our beloved pets to the list over the past few months.  I know how very busy you are,and you may not even be aware of this site.  I just felt that Marvin should have his memory on the honor roll of others before him.  I know that he was welcomed when he crossed the Rainbow Bridge................Sincerely, Karen Rosenbaum, Orange City, Florida.

Governor Bush,
I receive the email updates every week and enjoy reading them very much.  I 
have sent you emails in the past and have enjoyed hearing back from you. 
Many thanks.
I just wanted to take a moment to let you know how thankful I am that we 
here in Florida have you for our Governor.  You will be sorely missed after 
you leave office. Your calm leadership and honesty have always been 
something that I have admired. You always bring common sense to the 
forefront along with your support for doing the right thing. That is not an 
easy thing to do.
I don't have alot of money to contribute to help to get you into another 
public office , but if there is ever anything that I can do to help get your 
ideas and visions before the voting public.. please know I would be honored 
to help.
I will continue to look forward to watching you during the remainder of your 
term.
With much gratitude and appreciation for a job well done,

Respectfully yours,
Sue Betz

After living in Virginia for 40 years, I moved to Orlando this year hoping life would be easier. My expeditions were correct! Each goverment office I've been to here, I was treated like a real person. The employees have been as nice as they can be, I left feeling like I've made a new friend. I used to hate paying all the taxes in Virginia, I had to fill my windshield up with stickers & paid thousands upon thousands of dollars throughout my lifetime just to drive my car. In Florida, I feel like I should pay more! Where are the state taxes?? I just don't understand how Virginia could charge so much, & still not be able to provide a nice state. There are 10 times the people here, but the traffic problems don't even compare to the problems in the Norfolk area. I just wanted to thank someone for this great state, & I figured you the man to talk to! For the first time in my life, I feel like I belong somewhere, Thank you so much Mr. Bush

Subject: Volunteering for the Republican Party

It is rather upsetting to communicate with you regarding a matter that should have been handled more efficiently and more quickly.
 
In March of this year I filled out an on-line volunteer form for the Orange County Republican Party.   Although according to the website someone would contact me right away regarding how I might contribute, to date I have not received so much as an acknowledgement of my effort.
 
Perhaps the Republican Party here in Orange County and, by extension, in Florida, feels that it has enough volunteers or perhaps it feels that it need not make any effort to increase its numbers.  Regardless, not acknowledging my effort as a voter to contribute  is tantamount to saying that neither my vote nor my efforts count.  And, I know this is not the case.
 
As a naturalized American Citizen, I am deeply disappointed that the right to vote and my status as citizen for which I worked so hard are being treated with such carelessness.  
 
If the Republican Party does not need my services or does not wish to avail itself of my services, then fine.  At the very least,  I would appreciate an acknowledgement and some communication to that effect.
 
I look forward to your response.  In the meantime, take care and stay well.

Governor Bush,

I lived here in Pensacola, Florida when you were first elected, in 1998.  I voted for you.  I have since moved to Guam, then San Diego, only to return back here, Molino this time.

By and large, I think you have done a fine job governing this state.  I don't know how often someone writes to tell you that, so I'm telling you now.

I write my representatives on a fairly routine basis; asking them to support this bill, oppose that one, ecetera.  I just thought it was time to send a letter that does not have an agenda.

As a private citizen and as a Sailor, I appreciate the hard work you have done for this state.  It has made a difference.

I don't know what your future plans are (though the media does love to speculate), but whatever you choose to do, I wish you good luck.  If you choose to represent me again in an elected capacity, you can count on my vote.

Sincerely,

Subject:	 A Sincere Thank-You to Three of your Fire Chiefs


Dear Governor Bush,

We would sincerely like to commend three of your fire chiefs for coming to
our aid last week.   Mr. Natale Ippolito, Fire Chief of the San Carlos Fire
& Rescue,  Mr. Dan Gourley, Fire Chief of Bonita Springs Fire & Rescue and
a third man for whom we, unfortunately, have no identification.  This is
how our story unfolds.

On Sunday, May 7, 2006, my friend Vicki and I arrived at the Ft. Myers
Airport from New England.  We picked up our rental car and headed off to
Marco Island for a week of sun and relaxation.  We decided to get off at
exit 107 (Naples) to pick up some supplies for our room.  Once back on the
road to Marco Island we apparently went past our exit and picked up Rt. 75
farther south than we realized.  A short distance later we realized that
the air conditioner in our vehicle wasn't working properly and the car was
overheating.  We called the rental car agency and explained where we were.
They informed us that we had missed our exit and that we were on Alligator
Alley, heading towards Miami.  At this point the car completely stalled and
we were having trouble getting a signal on our cell phone.  We found
ourselves stuck on the side of the road and frightened for our safety.  In
our panic,  we decide to walk a half mile back to the nearest emergency
call box in the hope that it was working properly.  We were able to call
911 and were told that the Road Rangers would be contacted and given our
location.  No one came to our aid.  The temperature was in the low to mid
90's with high humidity and we had no water.

A while later two white SUV's with official lettering on the side and
emergency lights on the roof drove by us.  Thinking they were the Road
Rangers, I jumped up and waved my arms to flag them down but they drove
past us.  We assumed they hadn't seen us.  But suddenly, they stopped,
turned around and came to our aid.  Needless to say we were very grateful
and relieved to have been rescued by the three fire chiefs mentioned above.
These gentlemen stayed with us for the next 2 hours until the flat-bed
truck from the rental agency brought us our replacement vehicle.  They
definitely went above and beyond for us and we very much appreciate that
they did.  We felt that their act of kindness deserved a letter to you to
be sure you realized what wonderful people you have working for you and the
beautiful State of Florida.

With sincere thanks and appreciation,

Gov. Bush, i did send this to your brother but i dont know if he got to read it.. and i really would like for him to read it because it came from my son who is currently serving in the army.. I think that its nice to hear an opionion of someone who there and how they feel, several people read this letter and were touched by what he had to say...
 
I got a message today on myspace and someone ask me why i  was fighting in a war tht we have no reason to be fighting and it pissed me off so heres my reply and alot people ask me why i joined the army in time of war so here is my reply for everyone who wonders,
 
I joined the army so i could fight for what  i believe in, one of the reason we are over here in Iraq is to give the kids over her the right to live free and not be scared all their life, before we came to this country the people were scared fro their life along with their kids and that's not right, so wew have every right to be here no one should live in fear.. I don't fight  for me i fight for the people but most of all the kids.. They deserve the right to be free and live their life like we do because what kind of childhood is it to live in fear.. I will keep fighting as long as their are kids living in fear, so we are here for a good reason, If you could see the face of the kids from when we first came here and now you would see what I'm talking about the kids are happy now and aren't scared to come out of their house and play.. So I'm glad i am here and i will keep coming back over as long as it takes to make this country free like the  America and i will do anything it takes to win because i love kids and they deserve to be free..So to all my family and freinds please tell the kids i love them, and if they ask why i am over her tell them im helping the kids over here..
 
I'm sorry if this message pisses anyone off i dont care because its the truth we her doing good..   please give this to your brother and please read this yourself im very proud of my son if you would like to know his name let me know thank you donna

Our Medicaid folks can only assist if and when someone is determined eligible for services by DCF…so I'm not sure why they would refer to us.  
 
But I am forwarding to our Health Facility folks who may be able to provide information about hospital billing mediation and or indigent programs within facilities.

Hey folks....according to our transltor, they do not know what to do with a $5,000 hospital bill.  They called Social Security who told them to call DCF, DCF told them to call Medicaid, medicaid told them to call DCF.  They don't know what to do now and need help to pay this bill.  Also, we can't tell if they have social security or medicaid from their letter.
 
Can you folks see what is up and what can be done?

Dear Jeb,
 
Just wanted to give thanks to you for a great job during the past hurricane seasons.  You always seem to have a handle on things when it comes to those late summer windy months.  The press conferences you do prior and post storm...definitely communicate to the public that you are doing what needs to be done.
 
 
Thanks Again,

Hello, Honorable Governor Bush. My name is Lynn Deem. My husband Michael Shawn Deem, a Florida resident in the (active duty) Army, died in Iraq last year. You attempted to reach me by telephone in Georgia several times and, although we did not speak personally, I appreciate your concern for our family. You may recall that you did speak with my father-in-law and his special education students in West Virginia. Since Michael's death, I moved back to our home in Rockledge, Florida.
 
My father-in-law mentioned that there will be a memorial/tribute at the Governor's Mansion in June, but I did not see any information on the website. Would you be so kind as to let me know the details?
 
My contact information is:

Dear Governor Bush, 

It is my understanding that the legislation dealing with the FHSAA has been passed by both branches and appears to be ready to go to the Governor.

First, thank you for working to address this issue which has a broad impact across our state with families. It is my hope that the Task Force will be able to clearly identify areas that the FHSAA should address to correct in any areas relating to recruiting, but still permitting the families of Florida a choice in education at any time in their child's education without penalizing the student.

When it comes time to appoint members to the Task Force I will have a keen interest in this for not only the school I represent as the Administrator, but also the families and students across our state who want free choice. I am confident any concerns of the FHSAA can be addressed without affecting our families in a way that limits their choice for education.

There are several people at North Florida Christian who are ready to be a part of the Task Force including myself.

 

Sincerely,

Charles R. Fielding

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I just thought I would thank you for being a great Governor.  As our hurricane season approaches, I just wanted you how much I appreciate what you are doing for our state.   know how hard it is to please everyone (my significant other is a City Manger) But  I believe for the most part, that people really do care about their communities and when it comes down to it, are there when you need them.  I have lived in Southwest Florida for over 34 years and have really seen the changes in our state.  

 

I heard you answer your own e-mails so I thought what the heck, give it a try…

 

Happy Tuesday!

You attended my graduation at St. Pete College.  I sooooooooo wanted to thank you for all you have done for my state, but you had to leave before I reached the podium.  You need to know that I have never been polled, but I feel that you are one very REAL and FEELING person, and that I cheered your valiant efforts for the bill you passed for Terri Schiavo.  Please accept my gratitude for all of your efforts on her behalf.....you are a Gentleman and a Scholar!  

Also, your efforts in the education arena are most impressive, and I thank you for that as well.  I would bring to your attention that some of our (existing) elementary teachers should be evaluated more closely, as I know first-hand that inadequacies in special education are profound ( and this would date to the mid-90's)

As is often the case, you might have to be dead before you are fully appreciated....but I, for one, want you to know that I fully appreciate you and your efforts while you are still with us; and since (as Carl Kuttler put it), you will be looking for a job soon.....please keep being YOU...with the most maximum possible effect ~wink~

Gov. Bush,
 
After witnessing the atrocities that occurred in the state of Louisiana in the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, I wish to thank you for being such a strong and courageous leader during Florida's bout with Hurricanes Charlie, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. My small community of Poinciana (in Osceola and Polk Counties) was quite devastated by these storms. Your visit here did wonders for our morale, and brought us together to help each other. 
 
It is SO very apparent to me what a huge difference having a good governor made for us Floridians. You were prepared, and in turn, you prepared us for our responsibilities during such a treacherous time. You are the example of what a governor should be, and I'd like to thank you on behalf of myself, my family, my friends and neighbors for all you did, and all you continue to do for our state. 
 
Please know that your constituents appreciate all of your hard work and dedication to our well-being. Thank you for your service. Perhaps you might consider serving your country at some point, as your father and brother have? You would have my full support.

My name is Larry Kung with the GIS section in Div. of Emergency Management here in Tallahassee.  We are compiling a list of the landing zones for each county's EOC (Emer. Op. Center) for the governor to visit in case of an event.  Which we are requesting the county EM directors to provide the locations of the landing zones.  My question is what criteria do I supply them for identifying this landing zone.  Such as: how big of an open area, how heavy is the helicopter, how close can the nearest overhead line be, does the pilot want the location in decimal degree or degree/minute/second,  ...etc.?  A request was made last year from the gov's office to provide this list but we did not get the criteria and I do not know who made the request.  Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions.

Good Morning,

 

I am Glenn Sutphin, Legislative director, department of military Affairs. Governor Bush has asked me to see where we can assist you in getting a hardship tour in Florida. As you know these tours are only 12 months in length. I need a contact in your Command so that I may see where we can help. I must point out that Governor Bush has authority in Title 32 issues only, not Title 10 such as your duty entails, but the governor always wants to assist military families when ever possible.

This is kind of you to Ask the Governor and to reply to me.  
 
But I must say I have contacted Eglin Fed Credit Union after sending the EMail, and they tell me that they (EFCU) GOOFED and all of those failures they sent me on my account were in error and that the law already exist that has an active credit card is an active account.  They just did not apply it to my account.  I hope they look at all the other accounts they have.
 
Thank you so much.
 
Appreciate it.

Thank you Governor for taking my Email.
 
 
I have an account in a Federal Credit Union in Florida and I have lived out of state for many years in order to make a living.   I opened this account in 1965 and have had it open ever since.  I have a MasterCard within that account.  Every once in a while I get a flag from the Credit union telling me I haven't used the account in the past enough and the state will take the account if I do not do certain things. 
 
This was probably a good idea years ago but I think you should look at again in today's environment.  I use the Credit Card many, many times a month as most people do. I trust this Credit Union with my Credit Card more than I trust other places.  Here is the Point.  
 
Why not attach to the law the use of the Credit card within the account as a reference to USAGE?
 
Please look at this.

Dear Gov.Jeb,
Just a few lines to let you know that my family and I are proud of what you have done and are continuing to achieve in our beautiful State of Florida. We are furthermore proud that you embraced Catholicism and hope and pray that you will one day make it to the White House. A good catholic principled man in the White house would help to lead this country through the morass of moral issues that are facing today’s society in America. And as America leads the world in many ways – your leadership would be crucial to making Christ and his teachings more relevant to our world.
God bless you, Columba and the children and keep you all safe.
Respectfully,
Rudi Fernandes

Dear Governor,
 
Thanks so much for supporting the film industry bills and the film industry in Florida. I am grateful that you find value in presence of the arts in Florida. Thanks for your support. I have also been impressed with your leadership through the hurricanes the past few years. I know it most likely has been a  challenge to see the state through the battle of wind and rain. However, your commitment to our safety has been evident. 
 
God Bless you in your work and future en devours,

Just a quick note... 
I am a new teacher in the Broward County system.  I know that there are
things that are wrong that need to be addressed.. but I want to thank you
and all the others who are trying to make public education the best it can
be. I'm tired of reading all the negative posts on our intranet.. and
disgusted by the disrespect to you and our President. It kind of clears up
why many of the students that we teach show us disrespect. You learn by
example. I believe that we should respect those in authority for the
position that they hold, and not just the person themself. 
Anyway, I just wanted to say "thank you" and "God bless your efforts".

Hello!  Governor Bush. I was happy to have voted for you in your first election bid and happier in the second. The past democratic governors(Chiles & Graham) were awful self serving individuals.The former. Gov. Martinez (mayor of Tampa) appeared to be fearful. You have shown that good government does exist and you stay the course of your views/statement and ideals. I will miss you and your leadership. The state republicans now to me in a chaotic mode. I am retired but your school voucher was great and showing they work and are good for children and education. I went to elemntery parochial schools( some nuns were tuff) and public high schools in Mass.  The public school had no discipline. Teacher were for the most part unwilling to be involved in the success of there student.You are the best grounded servant of the people I have ever seen and heard. You have wisdom above your years. A public speaking demeanor that is better and better. I hope you stay in Florida and help the party. I see now the party is fracturing in state and federal level due to fear of following the conviction that may have got them elected. Democrat have never stood for the people only liberal ideas that know one should be held accountable. Best Wishes God bless you and all your family.A special thanks to your Mon and Dad and President Bush..    Resident for over 25 Yrs.  Andre Arguin Clearwater Fl. 33756

I enjoyed reading the recent article on you in the GQ magazine.

I learned a lot about you that I did not know.

I want to say that I sincerely believe you have done a great job as Governor of our Great State of Florida over the past 8 years (almost) and want to thank you for being a Great Statesman.

I want to wish you the very best in your political career and hope that it is not over yet.

 

I did have the pleasure of meeting you personally in Tampa, a few years ago at the Tampa Sheriff’s Ceremony for fallen officers and also enjoyed the opportunity of taking a picture together with you.  I have proudly displayed that photo in my office.

I have also met you at the Capital in Tallahassee while lobby certain bills with ex-Speaker Ralph Haben.

 

Good Luck with everything.

 

I hope to see you some day soon

 Dear Governor Bush,                                                        
                                                                            
 My name is Tracey Lachance, my mother passed away on March 18,2006, she    
 was in a nursing                                                           
 Home and I was trying to have her put on medicaid before she passed away.  
 Now the nursing home                                                       
 Still wants me to turn in all of my mother's paperwork  to the Department  
 of Children and Families                                                   
 To have her qualified for medicaid. I think that would be a waste of time, 
 and tax payers money.                                                      
 I would like to know how this department can have a dead person qualify    
 for this program.                                                          
                                                                            
 I am also getting a bill from the nursing home asking me to pay the        
 remainder of this bill. I was told                                         
 By  a law firm that if I did not sign my mother into the nursing home,     
 then I am not responsible for                                              
 The bill. I have tried to have a lawyer help me with this matter, but they 
 all say that they can not                                                  
 Help me.   When my mother passed away there was no estate. She did  have a 
 Life Insurance Policy, but that was to pay for the funeral. I would like   
 to know what rights are on this matter.

Dear Concerned Parent:

 

Thank you for writing to the Department of Education about the FCAT Parent Network.  I have been asked to respond to your concerns.

 

Letters informing parents of the FCAT Parent Network were sent to schools in early April so they could be distributed to parents before the online release of 2006 FCAT Reading and Mathematics scores.  These letters provide login information that will allow parents to access their child’s scores after they are posted.  It was not our intention that the site be ready when the letters were sent out to parents.  The Department of Education kindly requests that parents monitor the website for updated information about expected release dates for student scores.

 

Once student scores are posted, password and login boxes will appear on the FCAT Parent Network main page (www.fcatparentnetwork.com).  FCAT Reading and Mathematics Grade 3 and Retake reports will be available on Wednesday, May 3. When the exact dates for grades 4 through 10 are known, the website message will be updated.  

 

Thank you for writing.  The Department of Education is committed to ensuring the highest student achievement for all Florida students by creating an efficient educational system that is responsive to educational research and the concerns of students, parents, educators, and other community members.  Your participation in this endeavor is appreciated.

 

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Bush,
  My name is David Hollingsworth.
   I work at the Harley-Davidson dealership in St. Augustine, Florida. I am
sure
that you get pleas and requests for many things I hope you take this one to
heart.
  I have an employee and friend in Afghanistan right now who is scheduled to
return home in June or July. His sister was involved in a car wreck this past
weekend and died. I just received info on it this morning and do not have all
the details yet. His niece (Goddaughter) was also in the accident and is
currently in ICU. Can we please send this young man home to grieve with his
family and offer some support to them?
  I can fully understand if you cannot, but thought you, if anyone, could
make
this happen.
Respectfully, David Hollingsworth

Hello, my name is Maureen Grodzinski and my father is Col. (ret.)Darvin O. 
Patrick. He passed away 4/27 and his memorial service is in Orlando on Tue. 
May 2 at 7:00 pm at Baldwin-Fairchild Funeral Home, Pine Castle Chapel in 
Orlando, FL.  We will take him to Florida National Cemetary in Bushnell on 
Wed. 5/3 at 11:00 am where he will receive full honors.  He served his 
country with honor for over 33 years and as he served, my mother served.  He 
was a POW in the Philippines for three years in Cabanatuan.  He was the most 
honorable yet humble man I know.  Any gestures of condolenses from Governor 
Bush would be so very much appreciated. My father would never expect 
anything, he never considered that the government owed him a thing. It was 
his honor to serve and he did so proudly. He taught his children and 
grandchildren to respect our flag and nation. He was a great man. Thank you 
for any consideration.
We are attempting to get a presence of the Army at the memorial service. He 
will indeed have the honor guard at Florida National Cemetary but he can 
only have one honor guard.  The funeral director is attempting to get one or 
two army soldiers to stand by his casket at the memorial service. If you can 
assist, it would be wonderful.  Thank you for consideration of any 
participation you can offer. Very respectfully your, Maureen P. Grodzinski, 
loving daughter (cell-863-873-6438)

My very dear friend, Eric A. Palmisano was killed April 2, 2006 in a non-hostile vehicle rollover accident in Al Asad Province in Iraq. We recently held a full Military funeral in Chicago, Illinois so that Eric could be buried next to his father. The Governors of Illinois, Wisconsin, and California all decreed that capitol flags fly at half-staff during that day (April 22, 2006). All of this information can be verified on www.defenselink.mil Eric lived, studied, and worked in Orlando, FL for nearly 10 years before enlisting in the Marines in Florence, WI, where his mother and step-father live. The Orlando Sentinel will be publishing an article about Eric, who leaves behind his fiancée, Claire Kohake, as well as countless friends and family in Orlando and throughout Florida. Many of his friends will be traveling in from out of town to attend a Memorial Service which will be held at New Life Church of God by UCF in Orlando. I was hoping that the Capitol flags, including the Mayor’s flag,  would be flown at half-staff on Friday, April 28th, 2006 as we pay tribute to our dear friend, LCpl. Eric A. Palmisano. We have several prepared documents, eulogies, press releases, pictures, etc. if you need verification of this. Please let me know if you are able to accommodate this request. Thanks so much and have a great day.

Mr. Foster,
 
Thank you for your email to the Governor about the Asbestos issues on Marco Island.  I have been asked to respond to your concerns.
 
As indicated in our phone conversation, on Tuesday April 25th, our office is continuing our investigation and enforcement action on this issue.  The Department can not comment on statements made by citizens and local officials without knowing the context in which the statements were made.  
 
The Department has and will continue to make asbestos remediation a priority.  Our goals are unchanged and include three areas of interest.  First, the Department will make sure that future asbestos handling is conducted in a manner that meets all rules.  We have done this by multiple inspections, meetings and conversations with involved parties.  
 
Second, we will work with the City and Quality Enterprises to manage and dispose of the debris on the Glon property within the Rule requirements.  To date, the City has hired a contractor to monitor the asbestos and come up with a plan for removal of it from the Island.  Once that plan has been completed we will have inspectors onsite to ensure it follows the plan, as we did with the previous clean up.  The City is monitoring the air quality around the pile and have shown no problems to this date.
 
 Lastly, the Department will monitor the progress to ensure the environmental and public health and safety remain our focus.  We thank you for your emails and hope this email helps clarify the Department's actions thus far.  
 
If you have further questions please feel free to email me or contact me.
Regards,
Lisa Douglass

Subject: Asbestos Contamination on Marco Island Redux




Dear Governor Bush,
 
About 6 weeks ago, I contacted your office about the possibility of asbestos contamination on Marco Island caused by a contractor mishandling asbestos/cement pipe when rebuilding our main artery, Collier Boulevard. We had tried to bring this to the attention of the appropriate federal and state agencies but weren't taken seriously until your office stepped in and sent the DEP down here. Their inspector and ombudsman confirmed our contentions and it seemed that matters were well underway towards a satisfactory solution. For that, you have our deepest respect and our thanks. We had assumed that the asbestos issue had been put to rest.
 
Recently, asbestos again came to the forefront, but this time the issue was raised by the City. During an April 3 Council Meeting, Councilman, E. Glenn Tucker, stated that he had photographic evidence of asbestos appearing in areas of the island where it had not been found before. More recently, City Manager, Bill Moss, was reported in the newspapers as having stated to the Marco Island Chamber of Commerce that asbestos was mysteriously appearing in areas where it had not been found before, leaving the impression that CARES was somehow behind this.  ( http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2006/apr/19/issues_specific/ ). More recently, Mr. Moss was quoted in the Marco Island Sun Times as claiming that C.A.R.E.S., Inc. was using the asbestos issue to "embarrass the City" because we are opposed to the City plan to sewer the island. He reiterated the story of asbestos "walking around" the island. ( http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16508309&BRD=2256&PAG=461&dept_id=455823&rfi=6 ) These statements, if true, suggest clear, and presumably purposeful, violations of the Clean Air Act and I have reported them to the South Florida DEP. Unfortunately, the DEP has not responded so I must turn to you once again to request action.
 
As a private citizen and as Chairman of C.A.R.E.S., Inc., I respectfully request that your office contact FDEP and request that a thorough investigation of this matter be initiated immediately. Thanks to your intervention 6 weeks ago, FDEP intervened, a major contaminated site was remediate and declared safe, and FDEP assured us that all other contaminated sites have been "secured" and are under current investigation with steps taken towards their eventual remediation. On this basis, C.A.R.E.S. dropped the asbestos issue secure in the knowledge that it was being handled by competent authorities. The thought of asbestos now being moved from place to place on the island is cause for grave concern.

Dea Sir,
Since this covers my  views ( Ha ! How important  is that ? !!! ) on several topics, and  one on Florida, I thought I would send it on to you !
I can't bear the  thought of your leaving us as our GoV !! You have  been terriffic, and I thank you so  much .
Just do wish  , so much ,  you  could be  U.S. A.  President !
If I could  ever assist you in any way, I would consider it an honor !
Though, I must say, I have "resigned "from the formal 
Republican Party because I no longer   want to attend our local meetigs  without paying dues,and I dont' want to pay dues to any   division of the Republican Party that may go to support liberal  Republicans described below.  Our local  Party seems  very weak, and  though this county ( Bradford ) has   registered so many Republicans in recent years, they don't take part in the organization.
 
Sincerely,
Barbara Hall

To the ones hosting Tony's  show at the present time.
 
  I just hate it that time and soapbox opportunites are given to  Bob   Beckel (sp)..He is on Fox news TV all the  time .  Let  him go to CNN where he belongs !!   I know, I know, Fairness !!
Don't we go over board on that trying to prove we're fair ?  ! 
 So D--- sick of Bush  Bashing !!
 
  So glad you  did answer him about the drilling in Anwar...but you talked about it in the future.. 
 
The liberals need to be held accountable for  denying us that   for years !!     Bush tried again on his watch to push for that..The Democrats voted  him down again--now  they are the ones, successfully convincing the public, all these problems, festering for  years  , is the fault of the Republicans, this President....and  Vice Pres being in "OIL "  !!
 
Not helpful ,   is all the treasonists, yellow-bellied Republicans, so anxious to kiss the rear -end of the dominating left-wing, Bush  destroying, Press that they side with the enemy----Meaning  liberal Specter, Snowe, Collins, Hagel,  former conservatives ,Lott,, Graham,  and "whomever  I'm talking to colors my, so-called opinion", McCain !!
 
Members of congress may have a majority of those with  an "R" after their  name, but this is a  Socialistic congress when they add those numbers  to the democrat side of  voting on issues !!
 
Where can I  vote against Boortz getting your station ?
He is such a trojan horse !!  ----------Gives out just enough conservative B.S. to "HOOK " many Republicans..... When  his main  agenda is to  covertly  convince  listeners  they really need to be in the  Libertarian party ----  Gotta watch  him !!
 
I am a native  Floridian-- and you  are right ---not one politician is going to support drilling here because it it so dependent on tourist and the beaches !!! 
 
 We need to do our part.  As I understand it, the rigs would be so far out in the water they could not be  seen from the shore---and oil spills do not happen at the rigs ( they even  stand firm in hurricanes, such a the ones in  Louisiana  ),  Spills  happen when the tankers have a problem !!  Can  happen anywhere !!
 
No one loves Florida  more than me  ,  a 71 yr old, old  widow lady ( USAF  Col.  RET. , Military wife for   27 yrs ---Married 45 yrs before he passed away 4 years ago  )
When our only  Grandaughter was born  4 years ago, she was the  7th generation woman in a line  born in  Florida  !
 
I defend Dubya at  every opportunity.  I think he has been the most   unfairly  maligned President ever.  I  happen not to agree with him on the immigration, but I wouldn't on  anyone else either, because NO POLITICIAN  is going to committ literal suicide.  The  Mexican vote is now---after DECADES of letting it slide---------long before Bush was even Gov of Texas, or out of college--- much too large.....
I can  remember having heart failure over the adoption of the motor voter bill !
It is  so wrong to demand , now , that Geo Bush solve the problem..   Reagan is idolized, and I loved  him , too, .....BUT he openly provide huge amnesty !!!
 
This is un-conscienable to  do this to Pres Bush !!!!

I have been in contact with the wife and family. At this time the young Troop
did not have enough points to be promoted to SGT, but we are still working to

Friday. I have told the family of this and that we will continue to work on

Adendum Carta 
(Referencia:Promocion Corporal Pablo V.Mayorga) 
En lo referente al asunto relacionado con el  senor Luis D.Unda, a quien hago
referencia en la carta que solicitamos ayuda para nuestro hijo Pablo
V.Mayorga,miembro de U.S.Marines hago la siguiente aclaracion:
Luego de haber elaborado y enviado la carta en mencion, recibi una llamada
telefonica de la Base de Camp Lejune indicandome que lo sucedido con el senor
Unda,fue una mala interpretacion de parte nuestra,pues preguntaban su nombre
precisamente para darnos una cita con la persona indicada y conocer la
situacion real.La razon para este hecho es que en esos momentos se iba a
realizar una ceremonia en dicha base, presisamente para recordar a todos
quienes cayeron en combate durante el ano anterior.
En el resto del contenido de la carta enviada insistimos su ayuda y
cooperacion.Que Dios bendiga su gestion.
ATENTAMENTE
FAMILIA MAYORGA.

Sir,

I am trying to work the issue through his Commander but in all truth this is
a Title 10 issue and should be worked through a Congressional Inquiry, I have
instructed him on how to do this. Using Soldiers on permanent profile for
light duty in a combat zone is not unusual( if they do not need immediate
medical attention or if the wait will not effect them later on in life). I
have sent him all my contact data and will continue to monitor the issue.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399  



Dear Governor Bush:

My name is Specialist John J. Strain.  I am currently serving in Iraq and am
writing you today because I feel I have no other options and have been
advised by a member of my chain of command to do so.  I've been serving in
the Army honorably now for nearly three and a half years and have spent more
than half this time deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.  Currently, I am
assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry, 10th Mountain Division..  

My situation is this, I injured my back during a fall in Afghanistan in early
2003 and have been on temporary physical profile ever since (normally you
would be placed on permanent profile after a year) I was going to be
medically discharged due to the injury before deploying last year to Iraq but
I had the MEB process postponed until after the deployment as I felt I could
still contribute and I didn't feel right about leaving my buddies to go on
without me.  I was chosen to represent my unit to  work as part of the
Personal Security Detachment for our Brigade Commander Colonel Jeffrey J.
Snow where I have performed over 200 combat missions despite the pain I
suffer daily, I was honored to do so even though I realized I wouldn't be
able to be there for my comrades.  Now I'm in my eighth month of a yearlong
tour and I've been injured again, I suffered a dislocated shoulder (my fourth
now).  It has been recommended by an Air force Orthopedic Surgeon Major John
Tokish, as well 
as told to me by my Battalion Surgeon Major Eric Elgin that I in fact need to
have a reconstructive shoulder surgery and my shoulder will not get any
better until I have done so.  I was informed by Maj. Elgin that I would be
sent to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany and depending on their
evaluation would most likely be sent home for the surgery and informed my
wife and family of the incident and that I would soon be coming home for
surgery.  However, after Maj. Elgin spoke to my Company Commander Captain
Michael Pecina, I was pulled into the commander's office and informed I would
be detached from my current assignment and brought back to my company to pull
radio guard for the rest of the deployment.  

I understand there are other soldiers in the company, who are injured, and
they have been on permanent profile pulling radio guard for the entire
deployment, I however feel betrayed by my unit.  I feel as if they don't care
about my welfare or my family.  I haven't been put on permanent profile like
any of the others, even though I have had numerous x-rays and MRI's to
document my previous injury, and I have been risking my life driving around
Baghdad nearly six days a week while the other injured soldiers at the unit
have been cared for and kept back at Camp Liberty as far as possible from
danger.  I've given 100 percent of myself throughout my entire time in
service and never asked for or been given anything, I cannot  sleep at night
because I often have nightmares and when I don't have nightmares my back pain
and now my shoulder keep me from getting more than a few hours of sleep a
night.  I find myself wondering why I'm being broken down and for what?  Is
it worth it, an
d what effect is all of this going to have on my marriage?  My wife is having
health problems and is now a wreck because I told her I'd be coming home to
care for her and get surgery following the advice of two commissioned
officers.  I'm almost ready to give up, the Army is not just breaking me down
physically anymore, all of this is weighing down on my mentally now because
it's not just affecting me now it's hurting my family.  When will my unit
take care of me?  When I've given all I have left to give and all that is
left is a grieving wife at home?  What incentive do I have to continue to
give of myself?  My morale is shot and I feel alone in this great big Army.
What more can be expected of me than what I've already given, as it stands I
was already going to be discharged and be on disability after this deployment
if the current trend keeps up and more damage is done physically because I'm
not getting the medical treatment I need I may be prohibited from leading a
norma
l life in the civilian workforce when I do finally get discharged.  Where is
the honor in that?

	I apologize if I seem like I am just complaining, I assure you I am
not.  I honestly am becoming desperate and as I previously stated this is the
course of action that  a  Non Commissioned Officer I respect told me I should
take into my own hands because no one else in the Chain of Command will stand
up for soldiers anymore, all they care about is their own careers and getting
their next awards.  I feel ashamed that I am writing this letter and that I'm
doing something wrong but I have nowhere else to turn.  I just want to be
treated fairly and given the medical treatment I need.  All I've ever wanted
to do is serve my country and be a soldier, but I never imagined I'd see the
Army become so self-centered and careless when it comes to taking care of its
soldiers.  I don't know if there's anything you can do to help me, but if
there is I would be eternally thankful.  I just want to be treated as a human
being should, I am a soldier and I always will be but I'm not a robot an
d can only take so much physical abuse before I just can't do anymore.  I
want to be able to play with my kids and grandkids someday and be able to
throw a ball without having my shoulder dislocate because of this injury and
I don't see the Army caring about any of that.

Your chain of command should be able to assist you.  

 

But what are the steps that you can not complete on what web site.

 

You do have a certified copy in your military records.

 

I went online to this site and did not see anything that I could not fill out.

 

 www.vitalchek.com

 

Keep in mind that passport and records requests take time to accomplish.  So you need to ensure you have time to get it done.

 

If there is something your chain of command can not help you with let me know and I will see what we might be able to do here.  Remember you have all the information about yourself to be able to get the documents you need and fill out the paperwork.

Date: Wed, 29 Mar 2006 08:23:02 -0500



Mr. Hranek,

 

I am responding to the e-mail that you sent to our "FDLE Comments" website on March 27, 2006.  In your e-mail, you asked whether or not FDLE investigates complaints of officer misconduct, brutality, and false reports.  FDLE can only become involved in these types of investigations at the direction of the Governor.  Otherwise, the duty lies with the officer's employing agency to conduct an inquiry into issues that might involve officer misconduct.

 

Pursuant to Section 943.1395(5), Florida Statutes, the employing agency must conduct an internal investigation if it has cause to suspect that an officer has committed a possible "moral character" violation as outlined in Rule 11B-27.0011(4), Florida Administrative Code.  Your complaint could possibly give rise to such a suspicion on the employing agency's part.  If a violation is sustained, the employing agency is obligated statutorily to report their findings to the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission.

 

I recommend that you submit your complaint to the officer's employing agency for them to conduct an inquiry.  If your complaint involves the agency administrator (police chief, sheriff, etc.), I recommend that you forward your complaint directly to the Mayor's Office or the Governor's Office.  Please understand that our office does not have the statutory authority to conduct an independent investigation against an officer or an agency administrator.

 

If you have any questions regarding our process or if I can be of further assistance to you, please contact me at (850)410-8645 or via e-mail at glenhopkins@fdle.state.fl.us.

 

Sincerely,

 

Glen W. Hopkins, Training and Research Manager

Subject: [*] Please HELP my Family Recover


Dear Ma'am:
 
    This is a copy of any email I just sent to Gov Bush.  Ma'am, my Family needs so help in communicating with a Government Branch that is refusing to communicate with us.  Below is the context of the email I just sent to Gov Bush's email address.  Can either of you help us, please?
 
Good morning, Sir:
 
    Please HELP my Family recover.  Sir, my family is experiencing an unbelievable situation causing immense hurt and pain, further enhanced by a Governmental branch.  Perhaps you can help us come to closure on this situation.
 
    My Family was the victim of a brutal, heinous, incredibly hurtful allegation of Child Abuse.  The prime subject has been identified as myself, the father of our 4-year-old daughter.  The allegation was made via the Anonymous Abuse line, but my wife and I both know that the allegation was made by my wife's sister and her husband.
 
    This allegation was a purely vindictive attack on our Family as a result of my wife's sister's Crusade to take our child away from us and have us returned to our home Country, Canada.  My Family lives in Weston, Florida consisting of my wife, myself, and our child.  We are wholesome family that does not drink, smoke, do illegal drugs, or commit crime.  I used to work for a Sheriff's Office on the West Coast of Florida prior to moving to the East Coast of Florida.  We are a law-abiding, tax-contributing, and Family-valued unit, who is facing an excruciating attempt at trying to break us up based upon extended-family disagreements and dislikes for myself.
 
    Child Protective Services visited our home on Tuesday, April 4, 2006, in a convoy of Sheriff's vehicles and investigators.  They were responding to the extremely vulgar allegations made against us.  After enduring 7 hours of interrogations, the investigators gave me 2 options: They take the child away from both parents until the investigation is complete, or, I voluntarily relocate for between 1-4 days during the investigation.  Naturally, as painful as it would be to separate from my wife and child, I complied with relocating during the investigation, because it would naturally be in the best interests of my wife and child.  
 
    CPS performed various intrusive examinations on our child on Wednesday, April 5th - the very next day.  Our legal counsel nor my wife were permitted to be present during the examinations.  Our child's school was consulted by CPS, among other resources we're sure.
 
    It is now almost 3 weeks since the battery of investigations, interviews, and examinations have taken place, and CPS refuses to provide my wife or counsel with any update, whatsoever.  They rarely return any phone calls, and when they do, they keep telling us it will be just a "couple of days" before the investigation is wrapped up.  No charges have ever been laid against anyone, and I have not been asked to come in for any further questioning since April 4th.
 
    Our Family has been ripped apart and emotionally tormented over the last few weeks because of this.  We know that there is not one iota of evidence, because there is not any evidence to be found in regards to these false allegations.  Our child is a very out-going, happy, extroverted child who isn't shy or reclusive or scared of people, most often the characteristics of a child who could be a victim of abuse.  My wife and I have lovingly cherished and provided for our child - a child who's only concern might be an above-average hyperactivity and reduced attention-span for her age, but shows absolutely no other deficiencies, like any other "normal" 4-year-old child.
 
    My Family has endured almost 3 weeks of separation filled with anxiety, sadness and fits of crying, dealing with repeated requests by our child of "where is my daddy", "when is my daddy coming home to our family", "we miss daddy and I want to cry", "mommy let's go to daddy's new home"...and on and on and on.  Easter long-weekend, traditionally a Family-celebrated holiday period, was filled with loneliness, sadness, separation-anxiety, and depression.
 
    When will CPS finally admit they have not found any evidence whatsoever, that this will not be a case for "heroism" for "rescuing a child" in response to these clearly frivolous allegations?  When do they have to finally allow me to go home to my Family so we can all begin our recovery and rebuilding of a Family so violently attacked in such a heinous slinging of incredibly damaging allegations?  
 
    Can your office help us in ensuring this investigation wraps up in a responsible time-frame, ending these weeks of emotionally, devastating pain?
 
I thank you for your time and considerations, and, God Bless.
 
 
Fondly,

Mr Jeb Bush, no one can tell me why my son was not allowed to take the Reading portion of the FCAT test. Why is this so important? My son who now attends Space Coast Jr/Sen High School, in the 8th grade, In 2002 he scored a 2 on the reading portion, 2003 also scored a 2, in 2004 he scored a 3, this is looking good.  But in 2005 he scored a 1, what happened, so now in 2006 he was refused to let take the reading portion and now he has a 0 for 2006. This looks real bad by no fault of his. I talked to the 8th grade counselor Mr Bongrin, and Ms Kennedy another counselor they both said they did not how it happened.  So I called the area 5 Superintendent, Dr Bobay,  I talked to his secretary, she said I needed to talk to the principle Mr Spinner. I called and he was not availably, I was directed to the assistance principle Ms Hughes. I left a message and she called me back the next day.  She tried to tell me that this was a good thing because Ronnie would get all this extra help.  They all mention something about a NRT test that would be a backup for the FCAT. She had no explanation of why Ronnie was not allowed to take the test.

 

Ronnie is a very good student A & B most of the time.  He has only missed 8 days of school since kindergarten. This year he has missed 5 days. 4 days because of the flew Feb. 27,28, and March 1 & 3. He was taken to the Doctors and 2 of those days were excused. The Feb. 28, was the day the school took the reading portion of the FCAT test.  I called the school 3 or 4 times and talked to Ms McFadden in attendance, main office, and to Ms Kennedy in guidance.  I was told that Ronnie could take the make up test on March 7.  That he should go to the guidance office first thing Tuesday morning March 7.  Ronnie did that and was told he could not take the test by Ms Kennedy.

 

Ronnie is looking to go to Florida State College; he is an good football player. He like to take PE, this year he had to give up Band to take PE, because he had to take two reading classes.  He had wanted to take some classes next year to get High School Credits. Now he will have to take summer reading and two reading classes all year next year 9th grade.

 

I would like Ronnie to get his chance to take the FCAT Reading portion

Dear Governor,
 
As you move toward the end of your term as Governor, I wanted to take a moment to ''Thank You'' for a job well done. You've earned the right to walk away proud and accomplished.
 
I've had the pleasure of meeting you on a coupled of occasions, once at Sergio Pino's home during your first try at the office and later in St. Petersburg @ Bankers Insurance Company, and continue to be impressed with the essence of the man as much as what he's accomplished.
 
The educational reforms alone should be heralded far and wide. Prior to your efforts, we were light years behind the curve.
 
The privatization and accountability you brought to Tallahassee was refreshing. The challenges you met and overcame professionally and personally only serves to validate the votes cast in your favor.
 
I wish you continued success as well as that of your family.
 
Your Truly,

I just wanted to tell you what a great job you are doing as the Governor of Florida. I am specially encouraged by the direction you have taken with the challenge of education. I believe your forward thinking and the courage to do what others won’t has made you a Governor we will long remember. Please don’t let the “nay sayers” and party politicians dissuade you from your vision of what Florida is and what Florida should be. Keep up the great work and maybe we will be lucky enough to have a 3rd member of the Bush family in the White House.

Governor Bush, I appreciate the opportunity of your administration providing a means by which a citizen can  contact you by email.
 
We just bought a home in the Naples area and among the many enjoyable outlets that your state has for a retired couple both my wife and I spend a lot of time in the western Everglades fishing and bird watching. Along with your great beaches the Glades was a major factor why we picked Florida for our second home and possibly in the near future our first.
 
Considering fishing equipment, boats, and boat maintenance, guides and so forth it looks like we will spend close to 3k this year enjoying the Glades. Down the road we plan to buy a "flats" boat which will certainly up this amount.
 
I read in the paper lots of print telling how the state is trying to improve the water quality of the Glades which is great. I am not a tree hugger, or even a dedicated environmentalist. All we want along with a lot of other Floridians is a healthy body of water to do our thing be it back country fishing or a day on the beach. 
 
I also read how agricultural (namely, sugar and dairy) and developmental interests have a negative effect on the Glades.  I have no problem with Florida providing a favorable environment for these industries. I just hope that your state has at least now some restrictions to keep them from further harming the environment. Also, it wouldn't be a bad idea that they should be required to direct a portion of their profits towards cleaning up the messes they create. They have to accept the fact that they are  no longer number 1 in the case of the  $ they generate to the state of Florida versus the taxes and jobs created from tourism and the boating industry.   
 
Again, thank you very much for giving us a channel through which we can express our position to you.
 
Andy and Rosemary Falik

Governor,

	My law practice has become so intense that I have not taken the
time to complete my list of local "movers and shakers" for the meeting
we discussed by e-mail quite a long time ago on how to improve
Tallahassee as a capital and academic research host city.  I am
determined to gauge the commitment of each person who might be involved
so as not to waste your time.  

	There is substantial interest.  On the one hand it may be too
late but, on the other hand, the perspective you bring is what I want
the few people in town to hear.  

	However, I apologize that I have not done it yet.  

	The fact that you had been willing to meet with them, yet again,
after understandably frustrating earlier attempts, just adds to the many
reasons why I respect you, both for your candor and your willingness to
take another step.  
Respectfully,

Ken  vanAssenderp

Hello Gov. Bush
 
Attached to this email is a copy of a letter I sent to your brother President Bush. One of my teachers at school suggested sending you a copy also.  I don't know if anything can be done, but at this point in my life I don't know what else to do.  I know my uncle has been trying and I really don't want to lose him.  It upsets me that business's can get away with things like this and don't care about people just the dollar.  
 
 
 
thank you for your time.

To whom ever may receive this;

I can not believe that our gov’t has let the phone companies black mail your voters over receiving calls from our children in a state facility. Not that it should matter, but my son was put in a juvenile camp for children who have committed a sexual related crime. Lude and  lascivious. His biological father set him up and called the police. (no more child support). From the age of 12 he was released at 18 yrs of age and expected to act like an adult, think like an adult, and have desires, a maturity of an adult.  I am appalled at the expectations of this state ( which I was born in) just who is a 18 year old boy with the maturity a fifteen yr old supposed to be be able to see. Not a girl over his age he’s to immature. So he ends up dating someone on his level. He dated and finally ended up Living with a 15 yr old girl and her mother. When they ( Parents) decided to get rid of him. I’m sorry that’s another issue.  My gov’t has told me not to give out my credit card # to a unsolicited call, but that is what the state has set up. I should be able to communicate with my son. But now if the contracted service dose not have a deal with my phone service I’m expected to set up an account with them and pre pay a min. of 50.00 dollars. I am not given the opportunity to choose who I pay ( I am not an inmate and should have a choice. )

Bump on her head. I took her to doctor and she had a skull fracture. The hospital called dcf because I didn't know what happen. I can not afford to send the 

Children to a daycare. That was the whole problem. So they came out an investagated and I recevied daycare for 45 days from jcc. The problem is know they discontinued the services because the case with dcf is closed. But I know have the same problem I can't afford to keek them in daycare. I have been refeered to different agencys and none say they will assist with daycare. I got a call from the community connection and they advised for me to go back to jcc because just got funded. I did as she told me and I was treated very bad. They yelled out load at me in the lobby in front of everyone And said why do I think they should me when people have been on the wait list since 2005. I advised I was told to come in because I was already getting assistance befor while the case was open . They said they will not help me. I have been treated unacceptable form jcc. I don't what else to do.

The web page is inconsistant, often does  not show the
numbers for hours after they are posted by local tv.
and many times unacessable during most morings and day
time- what's the problem, hire a programer who stays up
past 11:15 and how about that why cant't they draw
the fantasy at the same time at 11pm like the lottery
