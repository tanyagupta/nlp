Their fellow protesters were at pains to emphasize that they were less concerned about their own affluent neighborhoods than about the residents of less affluent neighborhoods. The wealthier parts of Montgomery County have demonstrated a willingness to hire expensive lawyers to fight development. But who was going to look out for people who lack the resources to use the court system to endlessly delay projects they don’t like?

“That’s where the backyard trailers are going to go,” said Dale Barnhard, one of the more than 1,500 people who signed a petition opposing the “dramatic” change in rules.

And not just trailers. One protester insisted that people could set up shipping containers in their backyards. “Boxcars,” said another — with lights and music on all night.

The Council approved the new rules unanimously, making Montgomery County one of the largest jurisdictions to embrace what planners call “accessory dwelling units.” California passed a law in 2016 making it easier to add an apartment to a single-family home. In the following year, permits in Los Angeles jumped to nearly 2,000, from 90. Minneapolis, Seattle, neighboring Washington, D.C., and other cities also have rewritten their rules.

County leaders said they needed to provide more housing and a greater diversity of housing. Nationally, the share of households consisting of only one person has climbed to more than 25 percent in 2010, from less than 10 percent in 1950. In Montgomery County, the share is 24.9 percent; the county’s endless subdivisions of single-family homes were built for a bygone era.
